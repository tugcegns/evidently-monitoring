1,"BLOOMINGTON, Ill. — Three finalists have been selected for the inaugural Illinois Leopold Conservation Award.

Given in honor of renowned conservationist Aldo Leopold, the prestigious award is presented in 27 states to farmers, ranchers and forestland owners who inspire others with their dedication to land, water and wildlife habitat in their care.

In Illinois, the award is presented by the Sand County Foundation, national sponsor American Farmland Trust and state partners Illinois Corn and the Illinois Soybean Association.
• Frey Family Farms of Dahlgren in Hamilton County: Dennis and Jackie Frey have planted more than 20,000 trees and wetland areas have been created to refurbish ground water supplies and provide wildlife and beneficial insect pollinator habitat. Cover crops and no-till practices are used on corn and soybean fields to reduce erosion, increase biological activity, sequester carbon and retain moisture. Dennis Frey has served as a member and chairman of the local Soil and Water Conservation District for more than 25 years.
• Rademacher Farms of Gifford in Champaign County: Frank and Eric Rademacher have adopted a crop production system that utilizes no-till practices and roller-crimped cover crops before corn and soybean crops to improve water quality and soil health. High biomass cover crops provide weed control and prevent runoff. The Rademachers provide outreach to other farmers and policymakers to explain how conservation practices allow them to maximize profit while minimizing environmental impact.
• Jean Stewart of Rossville in Vermilion County: Stewart has utilized no-till practices on his farmland for the past 36 growing seasons to improve soil health, prevent erosion and reduce diesel costs. In addition to being an early adopter of cover crops to increase soil fertility, he also grows alfalfa to improve soil health on fields that had long been in a rotation of corn and soybeans. He installed buffer strips and terraces to control soil and water erosion and has served as a drainage district commissioner for 15 years.

“Leopold Conservation Award recipients are examples of how Aldo Leopold’s land ethic is alive and well today. Their dedication to conservation shows how individuals can improve the health of the land while producing food and fiber,” said Kevin McAleese, Sand County Foundation president and CEO.

The award recipient will be revealed at the Farm Progress Show in Decatur in August. The recipient receives $10,000, and his conservation success story will be featured in a video and in other outreach.

“We are living in a new time in U.S. history when climate-smart agriculture and protecting our natural resources is a high priority and an important topic of discussion,” said Steve Pitstick, Illinois Soybean Association chairman.

“It’s wonderful to be able to recognize farmers that are going above and beyond, paving new roads and setting a higher bar for future conservation efforts. The excitement for this award will build on itself, year after year, and we can’t wait to be a part of that.”

Earlier this year, owners of Illinois farmland and forests were encouraged to apply, or be nominated, for the award. Applications were reviewed by an independent panel of agricultural and conservation leaders.

“As the national sponsor for Sand County Foundation’s Leopold Conservation Award, American Farmland Trust celebrates the hard work and dedication of farmers, ranchers and forestland owners,” said John Piotti, AFT president and CEO.

“At AFT, we believe that conservation in agriculture requires a focus on the land, the practices and the people and this award recognizes the integral role of all three.”

The Illinois Leopold Conservation Award is made possible through the support of AFT, Illinois Corn, Illinois Soybean Association, Sand County Foundation, Haglund Ecology Fund, Farm Credit Illinois, American Farmland Trust of Illinois, Association of Illinois Water and Soil Conservation Districts, Illinois Department of Agriculture, Illinois Sustainable Ag Partnership, The Nature Conservancy and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service of Illinois.

“Illinois Corn is proud to be part of this important farmer recognition opportunity. We were so impressed with the quality of the applicants and felt good about the effort and time that is going into implementing conservation practices around Illinois,” said Jim Reed, Illinois Corn Marketing Board chairman.

“The passion for conservation and the desire to leave a family farm and a legacy of investment in the earth for the next generation of farmers floated off the pages of these applications.”","The inaugural Illinois Leopold Conservation Award is presented in 27 states to farmers, ranchers and forestland owners who commit their dedication to land, water and wildlife habitat in their care.

The grain markets continue to rally sharply higher with new crop corn and soybeans leading the charge higher.

Many traders look for the USDA Crop Progress report on Tuesday to take conditions down by 2-3% and that will also result in private analysts taking the projected corn and soybean yields lower. I have thought from day one that the USDA corn and soybean yield forecasts are unrealistic, says analyst Al Kluis.

On my charts this is a key two-week time period to watch for a possible, high. I am not willing to put on more hedges but will keep buying puts. It is dangerous to get bullish at this time of year, says Kluis.

4,"Indonesian prosecutors name three palm oil groups suspects in corruption case

Indonesia’s attorney general’s office has named three palm oil companies as suspects in a corruption investigation, alleging misconduct in obtaining export permits at a time when shipments were being restricted.

The investigation comes after Indonesia’s Supreme Court last month upheld a lower court’s jailing of executives at those companies for manipulating documents or submitting false data to obtain export permits.

Indonesia, which accounts for about 60% of the global palm oil supply, imposed tight export measures last year, including a three-week ban on shipments, to try to secure domestic supply to rein in soaring local cooking oil prices.

Prosecutors said the executives’ actions were on behalf of their companies, Singapore-based Wilmar Group and Musim Mas Group and Medan-based Permata Hijau Group and an investigation into the firms sought to recover state losses.

“Those three companies must be held responsible,” Ketut Sumedana, spokesperson for the attorney general’s office, said in a statement issued on Thursday (June 15).

Musim Mas Group on Friday said it respected legal proceedings and fully cooperated with the authorities. Wilmar Group said no official charges had been filed and the company had sought clarity on the issue.

A senior Indonesian trade ministry official has also been jailed in the case for abuse of power.","Indonesian prosecutors have named three palm oil groups suspects in a corruption investigation, alleging misconduct in obtaining export permits at a time when shipments were being restricted.

5,"Ukraine’s Kernel to open new $200 mln oil extraction plant in early 2024

Kernel, one of Ukraine’s largest agribusiness groups, is close to completing the construction of the Starokonstantinov oil extraction plant in the Khmelnitsky region, investment in which has already exceeded $200 million, Ukrainian media reported, citing a statement on the company’s website.

The plant, one of the largest in Europe, is 85% finished and the start-up and commissioning of the production line is scheduled for the beginning of 2024, the company said.

The plant will have capacity to process 1 million tonnes of sunflower seeds annually and produce unrefined pressed sunflower oil. In order to optimize processes, production will be fully automated. The company has installed equipment from Switzerland’s Buhler, Spain’s Sigma and Ukraine’s KMZ Industries.

The elevator will begin receiving sunflower seeds from the new harvest this fall.

Kernel CEO Yevgeny Osipov said the Starokonstantinov plant is the group’s eighth oil extraction plant and the first that the group is building in western Ukraine.

“By investing in the construction of a processing asset, we are stimulating local farmers to increase production of oil crops, showing them that they will have guaranteed sales in future,” Osipov was quoted as saying by the company’s press service.

The company also said that a thermal power plant has been built on plant property. Its solid fuel boiler will burn sunflower seed husks and produce steam for the plant. The project also includes the construction of treatment facilities.","Ukraine's Kernel is close to completing the construction of the Starokonstantinov oil extraction plant in the Khmelnitsky region, with an investment of $200 million.

8,"The first semester is coming to an end, and the scenario remains difficult for Brazilian pig farming, with weak prices for both live pigs and carcass. However, there are two positive factors at the moment: the strong pace of pork exports and the decline in the cost of animal nutrition. As for the cost, the scenario is more favorable due to the inversion of the cycle of the main feedstuff components. The Brazilian soybean crop was excellent, and there is the outlook for a large corn second crop entering the market in the second half of the year and good soybean and corn crops in the United States, barring a good climate evolution over the next few weeks.

Brazilian pork exports show a strong performance in this first semester but not enough to create a favorable environment for prices along the chain, that is, there is still great pork availability in the Brazilian market. Brazilian pork production is high, and adjustments are necessary for the market to find a balance point. Domestic demand is still unstable, a scenario that tends to last in the coming few weeks, considering that chicken and beef cuts are negatively biased, also suffering from oversupply. It is worth noting that pork occupies the third place in the preference of Brazilians, and this scenario of generalized surplus supply tends to suffer with the choice of consumers at the final end.

In the month, Brazil exported 99.459 thousand tons (fresh + industrialized), with an average price per ton of USD 2,502.08 and total revenue of USD 248.855 mln. The price per ton is the first highlight, reaching the highest level of the year, driven by the increase in prices paid by China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Chile, and the Philippines. The second point that draws attention is that China is acting in a more cautious way toward imports, and even so monthly results are coming strong. Brazil has been able to diversify shipments and open new markets, which is positive and can mitigate any future risk.

China is still the biggest importer, with 32.976 thousand tons in May, accounting for 33.16% of the volume. However, the country already acts more timidly in purchases, which is natural, as the Chinese market has been in crisis, relying on pork oversupply. May had the second-lowest volume shipped to China in the last 12 months.

A point worth noting is that the Chinese currency is currently undergoing a devaluation process, surpassing 7.10 yuan per dollar, a factor that makes imports more expensive and could lead the country to act more harshly in purchases over the coming few weeks.

The second-largest importer in May was the Philippines, with 9.486 thousand tons, corresponding to a share of 9.54%. The country still has a supply deficit caused by African swine fever, and the recovery of production is slower compared to China, for example, considering the country’s lower financial power. Throughout the semester, the Philippines are advancing both in terms of volume and price paid per ton. In March, the average price paid by the country was USD 2,305.88, against USD 2,648.35 registered in May, an increase of 14.85%.

The third-largest importer in May was Hong Kong, with 8.810 thousand tons and a share of 8.86%, and the fourth place was Chile, with 6.896 thousand tons and a share of 6.93%.

With the May data, the volume of pork exported by Brazil totaled 472.0 thousand tons in the first 5 months of 2023, an increase of 16.13% over the 406.5 thousand tons registered in the same period last year. Revenue up to May hit USD 1.138 bln, an increase of 29.17% over the USD 881.041 mln registered in the same period last year.","Brazilian pork exports remain strong, reaching 99,459 thousand tons in May, despite weak prices for both live pigs and carcass.

9,"Rapeseed production in Australia in the season 2023/24 may decrease by 41% – down to 4.9 million tons. Such forecast was announced by analysts of the National Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARES). According to experts, the drought in some regions of the country “will end the series of three consecutive record harvests”.

According to the German agricultural agency Agrarmarkt Informations-Gesellschaft mbH (AMI), there are two main reasons for this sharp decline: firstly, lower oilseed yields due to the expected El Niño weather phenomenon, and secondly, a partial reduction in the area under the crop.

AMI experts also noted that high harvests in recent years have led to overstocking of storage capacity and, as a result, problems with the quality of oilseeds.

“Nevertheless, the prospects of high profitability served as a sufficient incentive for rapeseed producers, as a result of which only low-yield lands in arid areas were withdrawn from crop rotation,” the agency added.","Australia has forecast a 41% drop in rapeseed production in the season 2023/24, down from 4.9 million tons due to the drought in some regions.

The Huntington requires reservations for the weekend, and early slots book up quickly. (Adult admission, $29.)All around the Huntington are the renowned Asian restaurants of the San Gabriel Valley, where Asians make up over half of the population in many of its cities. The San Gabriel branch of Golden Deli, a short drive from the gardens, has a menu that includes pho, bun and banh mi, but the must-order item is their cha gio. Filled with juicy pork, the rice paper-wrapped rolls crackle with crispness. South of the Huntington in Alhambra, Lunasia serves especially delicate dim sum, with steamed rice rolls translucent enough to reveal the pink shrimp inside and barbecue pork buns nearly airy in their lightness.There's something compelling about the bright white letters of the Hollywood sign. Yes! You're really here! And something grounding about actually going to see it, on dusty paths in green hills, rocky nature around the glitz. You can't hike to the sign, but you can get clear sightings in Griffith Park, particularly at the one-mile mark of the Mount Hollywood trail that starts at the Art Deco Griffith Observatory, which has stunning city views. There's also a flat loop around the Hollywood Reservoir, which was built in 1924 and provided water that was key to the city's growth. To capture that old somewhat Wild West feel, traverse the hills for an hour on horseback with Sunset Ranch Hollywood's Mulholland Trail Tour from their Beachwood Drive base ($75 per person).This city is flush with high-end omakase restaurants, which are as exquisite as they are expensive. It remains nearly impossible to get a table at chef Niki Nakayama's fine-dining n/naka in the Palms neighborhood, but booking a reservation at n/soto, her more casual spot with a handsome dining room in West Adams, doesn't require careful timing and frantic clicking. During the pandemic, Nakayama and her sous chef and partner, Carole Iida-Nakayama, pivoted to bento-box takeout at n/naka, then opened n/soto in 2022 to continue serving their refined takes on homestyle dishes. Their sushi is impeccable, but their hot dishes - crunchy chicken karaage, silky warm housemade tofu, rice and trout steaming in a donabe (a Japanese clay pot) - are as exciting as a perfect slice of toro.A trip to Los Angeles doesn't feel complete without a star sighting, and you can force the issue by going to a show at Largo at the Coronet on La Cienega. Comedians including ""Ted Lasso"" star Brett Goldstein and ""Saturday Night Live"" alumnae Melissa Villasenor and Sasheer Zamata test out their material here - you may hear bits that make their way into television specials - and invite friends to perform sets. Judd Apatow, Sarah Silverman and Will Ferrell have been known to show up. They're sometimes joined by musicians, and the way everyone chats casually on their mics makes you feel that the stars are, maybe, just like us. (Tickets from $35, book ahead.) Seating is first come first serve.Keep laughing over cocktails expertly stirred or vigorously shaken next door at the Roger Room. With its leather booths, long wooden bar and curlicue font throughout, it feels like a speakeasy with a side of saloon. There are seasonal drinks, but the classics taste right in this old-timey room. The dirty martini is bracingly crisp, the old-fashioned warm and round, and the Boulevardier not too sweet and just bitter enough. (Cocktails, about $16.)To enjoy pastries in a stunning space, head to Republique on La Brea. Inside the building, designed by architect Roy Seldon Price and built in the 1920s by actor Charlie Chaplin, stone arches soar in the double-height main room, flooded with sun from skylights and tall windows. Chef Margarita Manzke's baguettes are still warm from the oven in the morning - all the better for spreading cultured Normandy butter - and her pastries (about $5) often include flavors such as coconut and ube, inspired by her native Philippines.Every Sunday, the grounds of Fairfax High School turn into the Melrose Trading Post, an outdoor market with an eclectic mix of vintage Levi's and hyperlocal clothing, antique film cameras, handmade jewelry, soy candles and artisan goods. Once you find the tricky parking entrance at Fairfax and Clinton (valet parking is free), you pay $5 to enter the market. (That small fee goes to the school.) Bring cash for the entry fee and vendors. For pricier new wares, including the latest streetwear, there are shops along Fairfax and Melrose.The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, or LACMA (admission, $25), is currently replacing four buildings with the David Geffen Galleries, a single new building designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning architect Peter Zumthor. Within the existing truncated gallery spaces, one show, ""Afro-Atlantic Histories,"" examines the global slave trade through paintings, sculpture, video and drawings. Walk past Ai Weiwei's outdoor sculpture of bronze animal heads, then across Wilshire Boulevard to the Petersen Automotive Museum (admission, $20). You can't help but have fun seeing the Delorean from all three ""Back to the Future"" movies. Also, there's beauty in the long, royal blue curves of the 1939 Bugatti, a wedding gift from the French government to Mohammad Reza Pahlavi when he was the Prince of Persia. This is the best you'll get to see of LA car culture.You could spend 36 hours (or more) on a taco crawl to fully appreciate how this city has the best Mexican food in the United States. If you're in Mid-City, go to Sonoratown. Teodoro Diaz-Rodriguez Jr. and Jennifer Feltham opened their first shop downtown in 2016 to showcase their excellent tortillas and the northern Mexican specialties that go in them. Made with flour from the Mexican state of Sonora, the tortillas are at once supple and chewy and delicious enough to eat on their own. But they're even better filled: The steak in the costilla tacos ($3.50) is smoky and the chorizo perfectly spiced. To get even more tortilla per bite, try the chicken chivichanga ($5.50) and don't skip the horchata or seasonal agua fresca ($4.75). They sometimes have packs of their tortillas for sale.

13,"Buoyed by a swift economic rebound post-COVID, Dubai is racing to attract people and capital to drive long-term growth, betting it can avoid past debt crises that dented its global ambitions.

The approach pursued by the glitzy Gulf city-state is a reboot of a flamboyant economic model that for decades focused on property investment, tourism and inflows of foreign capital. Property is booming once more -- helped by Russian demand amid war in Ukraine and laxer residency rules -- and analysts this time see more guardrails in place against any repeat of the problems that subdued Dubai after the 2008 global credit crunch.

Home to the world's tallest tower and man-made islands, Dubai is chasing lofty new goals: A 10-year economic plan known as D33 aims to double the economy's size and make Dubai one of the top four global financial centres in a decade. It also wants to increase the length of its public beaches to 105 km from 21 km by 2040 and revive the dusty Palm Jebel Ali island abandoned in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

Tourist numbers in 2023 are almost back to levels of 2019, and last year Dubai was the world's fourth busiest ultra-prime property market, with 219 home sales over $10 million, according to Knight Frank research. At the same time, the property price surge and demand for the ultra-high-end segment is stirring memories of old excesses.

In 2008, the global financial crisis hit Dubai hard, leading to a flight of capital and people, a crash in property prices and highly leveraged flagship companies known as government-related entities (GREs) struggling to repay debts. Abu Dhabi, the UAE's oil-rich capital, eventually stepped in with a $20 billion lifeline, widely expected to be rolled over for a third time.

Nasser Al Shaikh, head of Dubai's finance department until 2009, told Reuters there is a risk Dubai will become too expensive to live in, and new developments need to ensure ample supply to meet demand for mid-income property as the population grows. ""If private developers cannot provide that, then the government and GREs could play a bigger role to do that and keep prices reasonable,"" Shaikh said, referring to the leading companies that have spearheaded Dubai's breakneck growth.

Dubai's population grew to over 3.55 million in 2022, official statistics show, up 2.1% from 2021, and 4% since 2020; S&P estimates it to surpass 4 million by 2026. LESSONS LEARNED

""There is always the risk of a major new round of borrowing (by GRE developers) on unrealistic expectations for real estate sales; however, I am hopeful that learning from previous cycles will mitigate this risk,"" said Justin Alexander, director at Khalij Economics and Gulf analyst at GlobalSource Partners. The Dubai Media Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on how its strategy is working towards ensuring growth is sustainable and not speculative.

Dubai set up a Debt Management Office in 2022, has repaid or restructured some outstanding debt, and announced plans to list government stakes in 10 companies to raise capital and deepen financial markets. It listed four of those last year. Shaikh said current finance officials have learned from the experiences of the last 15 years.

""Dubai has a strategy today, and development of capital markets is an important component of Dubai's overall financial proposition, not only to generate liquidity and to pay off debt but also to deepen capital markets within the financial sector."" 'GLOBAL SAFE HAVEN'

The United Arab Emirates' commercial centre, Dubai has shovelled resources into social and business reforms and sectors like digital technology. Oil revenue accounts for less than 2% of GDP, unlike the deep-pocketed capital Abu Dhabi. Average property prices rose 12.8% in Q1, with villa prices up almost 15%, according to property research firm CBRE. Villa sales have surpassed 2014 highs. Russian buyers were third in Betterhomes' May top 10 buyers, behind India and the UK.

""Dubai has really set itself as a global safe haven,"" said Richard Waind, group managing director at Betterhomes in Dubai, adding it was safe for families and stable politically and financially. ""It's no longer a speculative market. It's a market built on genuine investment. I think that's a very big difference to what we saw in 2008-2009 and perhaps the last peak around 2014.""

The rebound has also bolstered balance sheets of top Dubai Inc companies, including GREs such as Emirates airline, and majority government-owned but listed Emirates NBD and Emaar Properties. S&P has estimated Dubai's gross general government debt will fall to 51% of GDP, or about $66 billion by the end of 2023, from 78% of GDP in 2020, although broader public sector debt will stay elevated at about 100% of GDP due to high non-financial GRE liabilities.

Dubai's five-year credit default swaps, the cost of insuring against a default, reached a historic low of 66 basis points on March 8 this year, well below 316, the highest level it reached during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. TRANSPARENCY

Last year, Dubai attracted an estimated $12.8 billion in foreign direct investment capital according to the 2022 Financial Times 'fDi Markets' report published last month; FDI into Saudi Arabia was about 30 billion riyals ($8 billion). Despite growing competition from Gulf neighbours, Dubai's infrastructure, schools and hospitals remain in high demand.

Several people Reuters spoke to highlighted concerns about a lack of data and transparency, particularly among GREs, making it more difficult to properly assess Dubai's fundamentals. The UAE was placed on the ""grey list"" of global financial crime watchdog the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in 2022, increasing the risk of reduced capital inflows, a decrease in M&A activity and a potential lack of investor confidence.

But some prominent investors are sanguine. ""Dubai has been one of the most resilient destinations,"" said Philippe Zuber, CEO of Kerzner International which operates the luxury Atlantis and One&Only resorts, adding Dubai had kept borders open and businesses strong during COVID.

Kerzner, part-owned by Dubai's sovereign wealth fund, opened the ""ultra luxury"" Atlantis the Royal in 2023, its second Atlantis resort on Palm Jumeirah island. The Royal Mansion Penthouse, where Beyonce once stayed, costs $100,000 a night.

14,"TotalEnergies is actively responding to a call from its aviation customers to increase production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).
As from 2028, the company will be in a position to produce half a million tons of SAF, enough to cover the gradual increase in the European SAF blending mandate, set at 6% for 2030.
To this end, TotalEnergies is investing massively and has launched multiple SAF production projects. These include:
* Grandpuits – TotalEnergies is investing €400 million to convert the site into a zero-crude platform, primarily focused on producing SAF from circular feedstock such as animal fat and used cooking oil. Grandpuits will be able to produce 210,000 tons/y of SAF as of 2025, and a new investment has been announced to produce a further 75,000 tons/y by 2027.
* Normandy – TotalEnergies has started coprocessing SAF from used cooking oil at its Gonfreville refinery. The Company plans to increase annual production at the site to 40,000 tons from 2025. In addition, following technical work carried out with its aeronautical partners, TotalEnergies will produce an additional 150,000 tons/y of SAF by coprocessing HVO biodiesel produced at La Mède as soon as this production method is approved by the ASTM.
* La Mède – TotalEnergies has invested €340 million to convert its refinery into a biorefinery. Biodiesel produced at La Mède is already being used to make SAF at the TotalEnergies Oudalle plant near Le Havre. TotalEnergies is studying a new investment to have the capacity to process at La Mède, by 2024, 100% waste from the circular economy (used cooking oil and animal fat) to produce biofuels and SAF by coprocessing.
Beyond France, TotalEnergies aims to produce 1.5 million tons/y of SAF by 2030 at production units in Europe, the United States, Japan and South Korea, representing 10% of the world market by that date.
“TotalEnergies is taking action to meet the strong demand from the aviation industry to reduce its carbon footprint. Sustainable aviation fuel is essential to reducing the CO2 emissions of air transport, and its development is fully aligned with the Company’s climate ambition to get to net zero by 2050, together with society,” said Patrick Pouyanné, chairman and chief executive officer of TotalEnergies.","TotalEnergies is responding to a call from its aviation customers to increase production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

15,"Ukraine’s farmers are finishing the sowing season. Last week, 14 thou hectares were sown with grains and pulses, compared to 133.3 thou hectares the previous week and 193.5 thou hectares the week before. This is evidenced by the data of the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. Thus, as of June 15, the area under spring grains and pulses reached 5.618 mln ha, which is 3% higher than forecasted in March.

At the same time, the planted areas are 9.3% less than last year: as of June 9, 2022, according to the then reports of the Ministry of Agrarian Policy, they amounted to 6196.6 mln ha. The lag is mainly due to the most popular crops – corn and spring barley, the planted areas of which are 13.5% and 14.9% less than last year, respectively, and amount to 4.014 thou hectares and 810.0 thou hectares.

At the same time, corn plantings are already 11% higher than the Ministry of Agrarian Policy’s forecast of 3.618 mln ha, while barley planted on 78% of the expected 1.041 mln ha.

Millet plantings exceeded last year’s figures, with 49.2 thou hectares planted, but this is 82% of the area expected this year.

At the same time, the area under other crops is already higher than a year ago. This applies to spring wheat – 271.1 thou hectares (up 41.9%), peas – 138.5 thou hectares (up 5.7%), buckwheat – 119.7 thou hectares (up 59%).

According to the Ministry of Agrarian Policy, farmers in 14 regions have completed sowing of spring crops: Vinnytsia, Zakarpattia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kirovohrad, Lviv, Odesa, Poltava, Rivne, Sumy, Ternopil, Khmelnytsky, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, and Chernivtsi regions.

Compared to the pre-war year of 2021, the plantings of spring grains and pulses are down 24.7%, sunflower – 17.4%, sugar beet – 6.2%, while soybeans are up 27.6%.

Sugar beet sowing has been completed, with 213.1 thou hectares planted, which is 97% of the plan. The areas under sunflower and soybeans lag behind the targets by 94% and 96%, respectively, and amount to 5283.8 and 1773.5 thou hectares.

As a reminder, the U.S. has improved its forecast for the harvest and export of Ukrainian wheat and corn.

16,"KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI, US – In a 2021 interview with Sosland Publishing Co. President and editor Josh Sosland, Bunge Chief Executive Officer Gregory Heckman hinted that a seismic transaction, like the company’s recent acquisition of major grain trader Viterra, could be on the horizon.

The company, he said, was transitioning from a reorganizing and rebuilding phase to an era of expansion and growth.

“We’ve earned the right to grow,” Heckman said at the time. “We’ve put the performance together a number of quarters in a row for the last year and a half, and now we start to look at growth.”

The following year, Bunge entered partnerships with oil producer Chevron to crush oilseeds for renewable diesel and seedmaker Corteva to tailor crops for biofuel feedstocks. But the St. Louis, Missouri, US-based company’s boldest move was announced on June 13 of this year with the acquisition of Glencore-backed Viterra, another top agribusiness company with assets in 37 countries. Already the world’s largest soybean processor, Bunge is now positioned to expand its global footprint by adding Viterra’s numerous grain and oilseed origination and processing assets throughout the world.

For many years, Bunge has been the smallest of the so-called “ABCD” global agribusiness giants (ADM, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus). However, with this merger, which is expected to gain regulatory approval in mid-2024, Bunge would push past Louis Dreyfus, based on 2022 revenue, and closer to Cargill and ADM. Cargill posted sales of $165 billion last year, ADM $102 billion, Bunge/Viterra $67 billion and Louis Dreyfus $59 billion.

When Heckman joined Bunge in 2019, it was a financially underperforming company that in recent years had been a takeover target of several competitors, including ADM and Glencore. Bunge managed to fend off those bids and remain independent. It then hired Heckman and the rest, as they say, is history.

Soon after he was hired, Heckman went on a global “listening tour,” where he met with the company’s regional leaders. Heckman said he saw the need to make changes in the company’s management and operation structure, making it more centralized, as well as making a series of divestitures. In 2019, Bunge transferred its Brazilian sugar and bioenergy assets to a joint venture with BP. During the next three years, it ended its investment in a renewable energy company in Iowa, sold 35 US grain elevators to Zen-Noh Grain Corp., sold a rice mill in California, and sold a refinery in the Netherlands.

Having shed those assets, Bunge turned its focus to business segments where it saw a path toward satisfactory returns. The company continued to post stellar quarterly earnings and accumulate significant cash reserves, which would enable it to make key acquisitions when the opportunity and timing was right.

The acquisition of Viterra, which has grain origination assets in North America, South America, Australia and Europe, was significant not only for Bunge but the international grain industry as the ABCD companies, which already controlled an estimated 90% of the global grain trade before the announced merger, will increase their market share even more.

The dramatic turnaround at Bunge, which in only four years put itself in a position to be the hunter rather than the hunted, is one of the global grain industry’s most captivating developments in recent memory. It will be fascinating to see what other moves this nimble, innovative and ascending company makes in the coming years.","Bagge, a US-based agribusiness company, has made a dramatic turnaround after the company's recent acquisition of major grain trader Viterra.

17,"WASHINGTON, DC, US — The US Department of Agriculture in its June World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report marginally raised from May its forecasts for domestic wheat, corn and soybean supplies for 2023-24.

For wheat, the only one of the three major US crops in the 2023-24 marketing year (since June 1), a 6-million-bushel increase in 2023 production forecast at 1.136 billion bushels was carried through to the same increase for carryover on June 1, 2024, forecast at 562 million bushels. There were no changes from May to forecast 2023-24 wheat domestic use or exports. The average price of wheat paid to farmers in 2023-24 was forecast at $7.40 per bushel, down 30¢ from May and down $1.15, or 13%, from 2022-23.

The boost in wheat production was the result of a 2% increase from May in forecast hard red winter outturn at 525 million bushels, more than offsetting 1% decreases for both soft red winter at 402 million bushels and white winter at 209 million bushels. The increase in hard red winter wheat mostly resulted from beneficial rainfall in the dry southern Plains late in the growing season despite subpar crops in Oklahoma and top-producing Kansas. Production estimates were raised from May for Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas but were unchanged for Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and Montana.

The USDA in its weekly Crop Progress report said winter wheat as of June 11 was 1% harvested in Kansas, 26% in Oklahoma and 46% in Texas. Combines should move swiftly northward due to smaller crops in Oklahoma and Kansas although rain has caused some intermittent delays in Oklahoma.

For corn and soybeans, changes from May made to 2022-23 estimates were carried over to higher 2023-24 beginning stocks and carryover, with no changes to 2023-24 domestic use or export forecasts.

Corn carryover on Sept. 1, 2023, was forecast at 1.452 billion bushels, up 35 million bushels from May based on forecast 2022-23 exports at 1.725 billion bushels, down 50 million bushels, partially offset by a 15-million-bushel drop in imports at 25 million bushels. Corn carryover on Sept. 1, 2024, was forecast at 2.257 billion bushels, up 35 million bushels from May. The average price of corn paid to farmers in 2023-24 was unchanged from May at $4.80 per bushel, down $1.80 per bushel, or 27%, from 2022-23.

Soybean carryover on Sept. 1, 2023, was forecast at 230 million bushels, up 15 million bushels from May based on a 15-million-bushel decline in 2022-23 soybean crush, forecast at 2 billion bushels. Soybean carryover on Sept. 1, 2024, was forecast at 350 million bushels, up 15 million bushels from May. The average price of soybeans paid to farmers in 2023-24 was unchanged from May at $12.10 per bushel, down $2.10 per bushel, or 15%, from the current year.

The outlook from a meteorologist and several analysts at the recent Sosland Publishing Co. Purchasing Seminar in Kansas City, Missouri, US, was for generally larger grain and oilseed supplies, helped by increased planted and harvested area and favorable weather during the bulk of the North American growing season, with the main area of concern in Asia due to the potential impact of El Niño, which tends to bring dry conditions. Dryness in June in North America was expected to give way to improved moisture conditions in July.

June dryness was reflected in the USDA’s latest corn and soybean crop ratings. Corn in the 18 major producing states was rated 61% good to excellent as of June 11, down from 64% a week earlier and 72% at the same time last year. Soybeans in the 18 major states were rated 59% good to excellent as of June 11, down from 62% the prior week and 70% a year ago.

US wheat numbers will become more complete in July when the USDA makes its first survey-based durum and other spring wheat estimates, adding to survey-based winter wheat estimates that began in May. The first survey-based corn and soybean estimates will be released in August. Estimates of all crops will benefit from the June 30 Acreage report, which will update area forecasts from the March 31 Prospective Plantings report. The USDA in its May WASDE report, based on Prospective Plantings data and trend analysis, forecast record high US corn and soybean production in 2023.","The US Department of Agriculture's June World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report marginally raised from May its forecasts for domestic wheat, corn and soybean supplies for 2023-24.

The US Climate Prediction Centre said June 8 that weak El Nino conditions were observed across equatorial Pacific Ocean. The agency claimed there were 56% chances of the conditions strengthening during November-January.

In the meantime, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology on June 6 stepped up its probability forecast to “El Nino Alert” from “El Nino Watch”, indicating higher chances of an El Nino forming in late-2023.

El Nino ‘s probability is measured by warming of the surface waters in equatorial Pacific Ocean and the phenomenon leads to higher chances of lower rainfall, including drought in India, Southeast Asia, Australia, and the northern areas of South and Central America.

The last strong El Nino phenomenon occurred during 2014 to 2016 and brought drought in Australia and forest fires in Indonesia.

“In the case of South America, the association was mixed. In Chile on the western coast and Uruguay etc. on the eastern coast, the major effect was of excessive rains. In Argentina and central Brazil, the effects were unclear,” the UN Food and Agriculture Organization said in a report April 27.
• Australia’s wheat exports are likely to decline due to an anticipated drop in harvest. ABARES has pegged Australian wheat exports in MY 2023-24 at 21 million mt, down 29% on the year.
• Argentina’s wheat shipments are expected to pick up in MY 2023-24. The country will likely ship out 13.5 million mt, up from 5 million mt in the previous year.
• Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, assessed Australian premium white wheat FOB prices at $290/mt on June 14, up $4/mt on the day.

• Argentina is estimated to harvest 48 million mt soybean in MY 2023-24, nearly doubling on the year from 25 million mt in the previous season, the USDA said.
• Brazil soybean output is also pegged to rise around 4% higher on the year to 163 million mt in MY 2023-24, the USDA said.
• Argentina and Brazil are the world’s largest exporters of soybean oil and meal. Brazil is also a major supplier of raw soybeans.
• Increased availability of raw beans is also likely to push up crushing in these countries. Argentina’s soybean crushing is projected to increase 20% on the year to 36 million mt. In Brazil, raw bean processing is estimated to rise 4.2% over the year to 55.75 million mt.
• The increase in soybean production and crushing is also likely to boost global availability of soybean derivative in MY 2023-23.
• Global soybean meal production is expected to rise by over 6.18% on the year to 260.54 million mt. Soybean oil output will likely rise to 62.4 million mt, against 58.7 million mt in the previous year.
• Brazil raw soybean export is estimated to rise 4% on the year to 96.5 million mt for MY 2023-24.
• Argentina’s soybean meal shipments are pegged at 24.3 million mt, up 15.2% on the year while oil exports are projected at 4.5 million mt, up 20% on the year.
• Soybean meal exports from Brazil were also expected to increase slightly to 21.8 million mt from 21.65 million mt in the previous year.
• Platts assessed Soybean meal Brazil FOB Paranagua at $432.87/mt on June 14, down $13.01/mt on the day. Soybean oil Brazil FOB Paranagua was assessed at $947.11/mt on June 14, down $10.36/mt on the day.
• Platts assessed Soybean meal Argentina FOB up river at $442.79/mt June 14, down $9.7/mt on the day.
• A mild El Nino could reduce Malaysia’s palm oil production by 10% while a severe one could pull it down by as much as 20%, the Malaysian Palm Oil board said in May.
• In Indonesia, drier weather caused by the El Nino phenomenon may lead to forest fires and threaten harvest, the head of its weather agency said June 6.
• Malaysia’s palm oil yield may drop 23% due to prolonged dry weather, based on past track record, UOB Kay Hian analyst Leow Huey Chuen said.
• The US-based Foreign Agricultural Service lowered the world’s palm oil production outlook to 79.26 million mt for MY 2023-24 (October-September) on June 9, from 79.56 million mt a month ago.
• The effect of an El Nino event this year on production and trade could get more pronounced in 2024, analysts reckoned, as oil palm trees are resistant to water stress, but extended droughts will weigh on yields and quality of fruits.
• Global exports of palm oil in MY 2023-24 were revised lower by the FAS in June to 51.13 million mt from 51.33 million mt, largely on lower exports from Malaysia.
• Indonesia’s palm oil exports in MY 2023-24 are seen at 28.4 million mt, lower than its MY 2022-23 exports of 28.45 million mt, according to the FAS.

21,"Rapeseed prices rose 9.2% for the week amid drought in the US and Canada and forecasts of a reduced crop in Australia

Weather factors added to speculative pressure on soybeans last week, followed by canola, although prices remain well below a year ago.

August rapeseed futures on the Paris exchange were up 9.2% for the week at €473.5/t or $517.8/t, adding 23% since the start of the month, although they fell to their lowest since April 2021 on May 30 p level – 385 €/t. A year ago, rapeseed futures traded at €675/t, despite forecasts of a good global rapeseed harvest in 2022/23 MY.

The main driver of the rise in canola prices last week was a decline in canola production forecasts in Australia. In a new report, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Natural Resource Economics (ABARES) lowered its canola crop forecast to 4.9 million tonnes, well below the record 8.2 million tonnes for the 2022/23 season.

The reason for the adjustment will be this year’s drought caused by the El Nino phenomenon, which will end a three-year streak of record harvests, as well as a reduction in planted areas. In the main agricultural regions of Australia, autumn rains replenished soil moisture reserves and provided conditions for canola planting, but in the north the amount of precipitation was insufficient.

June’s dry weather across much of North America led to a sharp spike in speculative prices for soybeans in Chicago and canola in Winnipeg.

Overall, the weather has been favorable for canola planting in Canada, and crops are in good shape now, but analysts are predicting a lack of rainfall in the second half of June, particularly in the eastern Prairies

November canola futures on the Winnipeg exchange were up 6.8% for the week at CAD710/t, or $537/t.

The premium for November Canadian canola futures over European canola futures hit a record high of $92/t, but has now eased to $20/t, although it needs to be at least $30-50/t to enter the EU market .

In MY 2022/23, the EU imported 7.16 million tons of rapeseed, including 48.6% or 3.477 million tons from Australia, 41.4% or 2.96 million tons from Ukraine, and only 3.2% or 230 thousand t – from Canada (compared with last year’s 611,000 t).

In Ukraine, forward rapeseed prices remain at a low level of $320-330/t with delivery to the Danube ports, as it is not known how the Black Sea ports will work after July 18. For deliveries to the EU, exporters offer €390-400/t, but only with delivery in September-November.","Rapeseed prices rose 9.2% for the week amid drought in the US and Canada and forecasts of a reduced crop in Australia.

22,"June 19, 2023 – The Canola Council of Canada (CCC) is inviting applications for year two of Canola 4R Advantage through a new digital portal opening on June 26. Canola 4R Advantage, funded through Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada’s On-Farm Climate Action Fund (OFCAF), offers financial support to growers as they initiate or advance 4R Nutrient Stewardship on their farms.

The new, user-friendly digital portal will be available at canolacouncil.org/4r-advantage, and will allow growers to check the status of their participation through all stages of the process, from applying to submitting claims.

“We’re excited to launch the second year of Canola 4R Advantage and continue to build on canola growers’ leadership in sustainability,” says Jim Everson, CCC president. “Our program is focused on 4R practices to make the most efficient use of a growers’ fertilizer investment, which is good for farm productivity and the environment.”

To help growers prepare, the CCC has posted a demo video on how to apply, as well as a recorded webinar on year two program enhancements.

Year two of Canola 4R Advantage will cover expenses invoiced and paid by growers between April 1, 2023 and March 31, 2024. In year two, the program is expanding opportunities in several ways:
• More dollars per BMP: Growers can now seek up to $20,000 in assistance for each of the four eligible BMPs (soil testing, field zone mapping, enhanced efficiency fertilizer and preferred application) versus $6,000 per BMP in year one. Please note that year two applications for the preferred application BMP will be paused until 2024, when seasonal price differentials for nitrogen fertilizer can be determined.
• More BMPs per farm: Each farm can seek support for all BMPs covered by the program, versus a maximum of two BMPs in year one.
• Added eligibility for 4R plan development: The program can reimburse a portion of the consulting fees paid for a 4R designated agronomist to develop a growers’ 4R Nutrient Stewardship Plan.
• Funding continued adoption of new practices: Growers can seek funding to continue BMPs that were started since February 7, 2022.

Other program details established by AAFC will remain in place, including the 85 per cent reimbursement cap for eligible expenses and a maximum $75,000 limit in total funding received by a farm business across all OFCAF programs over the two-year OFCAF program lifetime.

23,"A sharp speculative increase in quotations for palm and soybean oil continues on the stock exchanges

A speculative rally in the soybean complex on the Chicago Stock Exchange, fueled by forecasts of hot and dry weather in the US soybean-growing regions in June, weighed on nearby canola and palm oil markets, which also started to rally.

Last week on the Chicago Stock Exchange, the number of November soybean contracts increased by 11%, and November soybean futures rose 3.8% to $493.2/t (+11.4% for the week) on Friday. while July soybean oil futures rose 4.5% to $1,288/t (+7.3% for the week).

Monday’s US crop status report will weigh on quotes, which remain under pressure from speculative demand.

August palm oil futures on Malaysia’s Bursa exchange rose for four straight sessions amid flooding in the country and a heatwave in the US, rising 6.3% on Friday to their highest since May 10 at 3,743 ringgit/t, or 811 $/t, adding 11.2% of the price for the week.

In Malaysia’s largest commodity-producing state, Sabah, palm plantations are experiencing water stress amid the first signs of El Niño, reducing yields and exacerbating labor shortages and fertilizer shortages seen over the past three years.

24,"Save power lines, Cyclone Biparjoy didn’t cause much damage to other infrastructure in Kutch. However, the “very severe cyclonic storm” wreaked havoc with the horticulture crops in this vast district having the largest area under perennial crops in Gujarat.

Mundra, Mandvi, Anjar, Nakhatrana and Bhuj talukas form the main date palm belt of Kutch. These talukas also have a majority of mango orchards in the district. Officers of the horticulture department of the state said gusty winds and torrential rains brought by the cyclone have caused extensive damage to orchards of date palms, mangoes and pomegranates.

“Strong winds have uprooted date palms and pomegranate plants, while whipping mangoes to the ground. Mundra, with lots of date palm orchards, is the worst-affected,” Mandip Parsaniya, deputy director of horticulture (DDH), told The Indian Express Monday.

According to the 2021-22 data with Gujarat’s Directorate of Horticulture, Kutch has 57,735 hectares (ha), or 13.14 per cent of the state’s total 4.39 lakh ha, under fruit crop cultivation.

Of this, 19,111 ha are under date palm cultivation, which is about 95 per cent of the state’s total 20,238 ha under cultivation of this horticulture crop. Similarly, Kutch farmers have planted pomegranates in 19,325 ha, which is more than 42 per cent of the state’s total pomegranate area of 45,648 ha.

It also has 10,960 ha under mango cultivation — the fourth highest after Valsad (37,344 ha), Navsari (33,855 ha) and Gir Somnath (14,301 ha) and almost seven per cent of the state’s total mango orchards area of 1.66 lakh ha.

Sapota or chikoo (1,010 ha), banana (2,615 ha) and coconut palms (940 ha) are other major horticultural crops in Kutch.

As per the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Biparjoy had made landfall between Mandvi and Karachi in Pakistan with its eye hitting Jakhau port in Abdasa taluka of Kutch on June 16. As per a state government release, the maximum wind speed of 120 kilometres per hour (kmph) was recorded at Koteshwar in Lakhpat — the western most taluka of the district during the landfall.

 “Villages such as Dhrab, Jarpara, in the Mandvi taluka has among the oldest date palm orchards of Kutch and unfortunately, the wind speed and rainfall were among the highest in this taluka, uprooting or bending into two scores of date palms and tilting others.

The palms that have bent into two are dead and it is also difficult to restore those uprooted. The only hope is to salvage those that have tilted,” Kapil Mohan Sharma, a scientist at the Mundra Date Palm Research Station (DPRS) of Sardarkrushinagar Dantiwada Agricultural University, said.

Sharma said DPRS in Mundra has around 4,000 date palms and this research and demonstration orchard has also faced the brunt of the cyclone. “Due to the cyclone, 125 date palms have been uprooted in our orchard, while around 50 others have tilted. In our orchard as well as in those of the farmers, old date palms that had grown tall and heavy are the worst affected,” said Sharma.

Seed propagated or seedling-origin native varieties, popularly called desi varieties, dominate the date palm cultivation in Kutch. Orchards having palms of these varieties are the oldest in the district, said Sharma. “With old palms, we lose genetic diversity important for any crop. The worst part is that the cyclone struck when the desi varieties were ready for harvest. The impact of rain on the dates set on desi variety palms that have managed to survive would manifest in a few days in the form of fruits either bursting or falling to the ground due to additional moisture,” the scientist said. “However, late ripening varieties such as Barhi, which are raised through tissue culture, are at a maturity stage called kimri and they may survive the adverse weather event.”

Naresh Seda, a farmer with a four-hectare date palm orchard, has been counting his losses since June 16. “Out of around 600 date palms that were 10 years or older and were 30 to 35 feet high, around 300 have been uprooted or bent into two by the cyclone. I harvested my first lot of 700 kg fresh dates of desi variety on June 12 to a Surat-based trader at a farm gate price of Rs 35 per kg. I was expecting a harvest of around Rs10 lakh this season but after the damage caused by the cyclone, my harvest would hardly be worth Rs 2 lakh,” said Seda, whose mango orchard in 1.5 ha has also been damaged. “The gusty winds whipped all the mangoes to the ground. There is hardly anything left on trees to harvest,” he added.

In Tharavada Nana village of Bhuj, Mukesh Patel, a farmer with 5.4-ha pomegranate orchard and two-ha mango orchard has been trying to restore pomegranate plants that have been uprooted. “My entire pomegranate orchard has been devastated. I have hired labourers to restore the plants in an upright position and try to keep them alive, hoping their root systems will be able to bear the shock. But it is also possible that my entire orchard may dry eventually,” said Patel.

On June 16, the government stated that horticulture crops in 30,000 ha in Kutch have been affected. It has launched a survey to assess the extent of the damage. Harshad Patel, the state government’s secretary in charge of Kutch, visited Manjal village in Nakhatrana taluka to oversee the survey work.

“We have formed 140 survey teams to assess damage to horticulture crops. Reports are expected to be available within a week,” DDH Parsaniya said, adding the banana crop, too, has suffered extensive damage.","Cyclone Biparjoy caused extensive damage to date palm, mango orchards of Kutch, India, and other major horticultural crops.

27,"The prolonged dry weather across the key regions of the US — especially in the eastern Corn Belt and northern parts of the Midwest — has stoked fears of drought for the corn and soybeans farmers, according to market sources.

The crop yield usually suffers during severe dryness, leading to sharp cuts in production and tightening supplies.

Anticipating the possibility for supply cuts in marketing year 2023-24 (September-August), the basis prices of both corn and soybean crops have risen in recent days.

Platts assessed CIF New Orleans corn for June deliveries at $274.50/mt June 16, up $10/mt week on week, and SOYBEX FOB New Orleans at $558.69/mt, $22/mt higher week on week, S&P Global Commodity Insights data showed.

The three-month outlook hints toward an extended period of warm and dry weather across major parts of the Midwest, the US Climate Prediction Center said June 15.

June to August is usually a critical development period for corn and soybeans crops in the US, market analysts said. So, while June was relatively dry, the Midwest will need sufficient rainfall in the upcoming months for crop development.

The current situation across major soybean and corn producing states does not look promising.

According to the US Drought Monitor report released June 15, about 49% of Iowa was suffering from drought in the week ended June 17, while 65% of Illinois and 75% of Nebraska were also under drought conditions.

Commodity analysts see sharp cuts in output potential for both corn and soybeans if the dryness persists in the upper Midwest and eastern Corn Belt, and to some extent in the southern plains.

The crop conditions ratings for corn and soybeans are already plunging amid a relatively dry June.

In the crop progress report for MY 2023-24 released June 12, the US Department of Agriculture showed 61% of corn and 59% of soybeans in good-to-excellent conditions, down 11 percentage points each for both crops on the year.

There is a general consensus among the market analysts that the crop ratings for both corn and soybeans will fall another 3-5 percentage points in the upcoming USDA’s crop progress report, due on June 20.

The US is forecast to produce record volumes of corn and soybeans in MY 2023-24. Corn production is pegged at 387.75 million mt, up 11% year on year, while soybeans output is projected at 122.7 million mt, up 5% on the year, the USDA said June 9 in its World Agriculture Supply and Demand Estimate report.

Given the dry weather trend in key parts of the country in June, market analysts think the USDA’s projections are a little optimistic.

There is a forecast for some rains by late June across the Midwest, according to the meteorologists, likely to bring temporary relief. But the fate of US corn and soybeans production in MY 2023-24 is now likely to be decided by weather in July and August.

 Source: Platts","The US has seen prolonged dry weather across the key regions of the Midwest, especially in the eastern Corn Belt and northern parts of the region, leading to sharp cuts in production and tightening supplies. Prices for corn and soybeans have risen in recent days, and the US Climate Prediction Center has warned of potential supply cuts in marketing year 2023-24 (September-August). The US Department of Agriculture has already released a crop progress report showing 61% of corn and 59% of soybeans in good-to-excellent conditions, down 11 percentage points each for both crops on the year. Despite this, market analysts think the USDA’s projections are a little optimistic. However, the fate of US corn and Soybeans production in MY 20 23-24 is now likely to be decided by weather in July and August.",0
28,"Joko Widodo, who rose to become Indonesia’s president in 2014 as a political outsider, is positioning himself to become a power broker in the world’s fourth-most populous nation potentially for decades to come.

The leader popularly known as Jokowi, 61, will step down next year after serving his second and final presidential term. While speculation had initially swirled that his allies would seek to change the constitution to help him stay on for another five years, the president is now focused on ensuring his influence continues well after he steps down, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.

That primarily involved months of behind-the-scenes dealings within his own ruling party to line up 54-year-old Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo as its candidate in next year’s election, a decision announced in April. Jokowi is now heavily involved in deciding Ganjar’s running mate, with an announcement possible as early as this week, said two of the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information.

But the president is also hedging his bets. Jokowi has strengthened ties with rival-turned-ally Prabowo Subianto, 71, who was the runner up in the last two presidential elections and bitterly fought the president before eventually agreeing to join his cabinet as defense minister after the last vote in 2019. Jokowi’s inner circle has discussed a possibility in which the president backs Prabowo as leader if Ganjar slips before the February 2024 election, the people said.

Jokowi’s maneuvering comes as his own burgeoning family dynasty begins to take shape. His eldest son and son-in-law are already mayors of important cities, while his youngest son is mulling an entry into politics — suggesting the president will play a key role in shaping the direction of Southeast Asia’s biggest economy potentially for decades to come.

Jokowi’s office didn’t respond to multiple emailed requests for comment, while Prabowo and Ganjar didn’t respond to written requests for comment.

In a June 7 speech in Singapore, Jokowi assured investors of policy continuity after he leaves office, including the completion of a $34 billion project to build a new capital called Nusantara from scratch in the jungle on the island of Borneo. The fifth and final stage is set to be completed in 2045.

“Your investment in Indonesia will continue to be safe,” Jokowi said. “Everything will be fine, don’t worry.”

Election fever is already starting to grip Indonesia, which will see some 205 million people cast ballots for legislative, gubernatorial and presidential candidates on Valentine’s Day next year. Red, green and yellow PDI-P flags can be seen all over Jakarta, along with banners saying “Jokowi Is The President We Love, Ganjar Is The President We Deserve.”

Jokowi’s approval rating hit an all-time high of 79.1% in May, showing that his political skills remain unrivaled in Indonesia. The latest election polls show Ganjar locked in a tight battle with Prabowo, a former son-in-law of former dictator Suharto, whose three-decade rule ended in 1998 as street protests paved the way for democracy to take root. Former Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan, who has declared his intention to seek the presidency, is running third.

The backroom dealing is aimed at ensuring the success of Jokowi’s signature policies, including the new capital and a push toward onshore processing of resources such as nickel, bauxite and copper to turn Indonesia into a high-income nation by 2045. Policy reversals in previous decades stalled key projects like Jakarta’s metro, which opened in 2019 after some 30 years of planning.

“Jokowi is really trying to become a kingmaker,” said Bivitri Susanti, a law expert and political commentator from the Indonesia Jentera School of Law, who has conducted research on legislative, civil society and corruption issues for more than a decade. “It’s to secure his project commitments like the new capital, ensure his family is protected after he steps down and also ensure his dynasty is secured.”

Accounts by five insiders with knowledge of the matter illustrate how Jokowi deftly secured the nomination of his ally Ganjar despite initial resistance from one of Indonesia’s enduring political families.

In a series of private meetings over the past six months, Jokowi outmaneuvered 76-year-old ex-President Megawati Soekarnoputri, the longtime head of the ruling Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), over who should be the presidential candidate, the people said.

The issue had caused tension within PDI-P for much of the past year. When Ganjar said in an October interview that he was ready to become president, Megawati reprimanded him and the party sanctioned him, warning that his comments were seen as insubordinate.

In a March meeting between Jokowi and Megawati, the pair discussed politics for three hours over a spread of Indonesian food that included chicken soup and vegetables stewed in coconut gravy. Those dishes were the favorites of Sukarno — Indonesia’s first leader and Megawati’s father — deliberately prepared by Jokowi as he sought to charm a woman who had helped facilitate his rise from furniture maker to president.

Megawati had been pushing for her daughter, House Speaker Puan Maharani, to be the party’s nominee. But Puan, 49, has struggled in the polls, failing to land in the top five candidates in any major survey. At the meal, Jokowi sought to persuade Megawati to see that Ganjar, who topped surveys along with Prabowo, provided the best chance to secure victory.

At the same time, Jokowi intensified his courtship of Prabowo, who initially said the 2019 election was “stolen” and threatened unrest before eventually joining the cabinet. The flirting started late last year, with Jokowi in November suggesting it was Prabowo’s time to become president. Prabowo also sung praises of the leader, saying Jokowi contributed the most to the nation’s defense force compared with past presidents.

Megawati grew wary that Jokowi was engineering a partnership between Ganjar and Prabowo, a move that could split PDI-P and ruin its chances of governing for another five years. If it holds on to power after the 2024 election, PDI-P could become the first political party to govern for three straight terms since democratic legislative elections were held in 1999 following the downfall of Suharto.

On April 21, roughly a month after the afternoon meal with Jokowi, Megawati gave in and announced that Ganjar would be PDI-P’s candidate. “My job and responsibility aren’t easy,” she said at a press briefing. “Because of that, I use common sense — my heart and my thoughts.”

Even as he backs Ganjar, Jokowi is still staying close to Prabowo. Just a day after Ganjar secured the PDI-P nomination, Prabowo visited Jokowi at his residence on the first day of Eid, usually reserved for family and close friends. People familiar with the matter said that Jokowi still has concerns that Ganjar may bow down to Megawati’s pressure and listen to her orders instead of his.

“Jokowi has the traits of past Javanese Kings who like to create competition between subordinates to test their loyalty,” said D. Nicky Fahrizal, a researcher at the Jakarta-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies.

Two members of Jokowi’s cabinet are among the favorites to become Ganjar’s potential running mate, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. One is Mahfud MD, the 66-year-old coordinating minister for political, legal, and security affairs, who is seen as a steady hand and loyalist of the president. Another is media tycoon-turned-State-Owned-Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir, 53.

The people said two other Jokowi favorites are also in the mix: Nasaruddin Umar, the 63-year-old imam of Jakarta’s Istiqlal Mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia, and East Java Governor Khofifah Indar Parawansa, 58, whose friendship with the president goes back to when he was mayor of Solo in Central Java.

Mahfud, Thohir, Umar and Khofifah didn’t reply to requests for comment.

During his time in office, Jokowi worked to expand his influence among business elites and younger leaders to support his priorities. Some joined his cabinet, including Thohir and Nadiem Makarim, co-founder of ride-hailing service Gojek.

And Jokowi’s family members are also waiting in the wings. Gibran Rakabuming Raka, the president’s 35-year-old eldest son and currently mayor of the family’s hometown of Surakarta, is seen by analysts as a possible candidate for Jakarta governor — the position that propelled Jokowi to the nation’s top job. His 31-year-old son-in-law, Bobby Nasution, is currently the mayor of Medan, Indonesia’s fifth-largest city.

“After almost 10 years of Jokowi’s presidency, I don’t think anyone underestimates Jokowi’s political acumen,” said Donna Priadi, Indonesia’s country director at consultancy firm Vriens and Partners. “Jokowi’s views will be sought after by the public after he leaves office.”","Joko Widodo, Indonesia's president, is positioning himself to become a power broker in the world's fourth-most populous nation potentially for decades to come.

30,"The
Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Transpacific Partnership 



The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for
Transpacific Partnership (CPTPP) came into force in December 2018 and
currently gathers 11 countries, namely Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile,
Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Viet Nam, and Japan, in the
Indo-Pacific region. After its formal application was submitted on 1 February
2021, an agreement was reached in March 2023 for the United Kingdom (UK) to
join the CPTPP. The UK’s accession to the CPTPP is expected to be finalised at
the upcoming CPTPP Ministerial Meeting in Auckland, New Zealand, in July 2023.
Currently, the combined Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the CPTPP’s Parties amounts
to USD 13.5 trillion, already making the CPTPP one of the largest preferential trade
agreements around the world, growing to more than USD 16.5 trillion with the addition
of the UK.



Originally, the negotiated agreement was called the Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP). Its negotiations were launched in March 2010 and were
concluded on 5 October 2015. The US was an original Party to the TPP, but, on
23 January 2017, the US Administration decided to withdraw from the Agreement.
The remaining 11 Parties agreed to go ahead with the Agreement without the US
and slightly revised the Agreement’s text, calling it the Comprehensive and
Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was signed in
March 2018. The CPTPP officially came into effect in December 2018 and,
currently, five more countries have formally applied to join it, namely Costa
Rica, China, Ecuador, Taiwan, and Uruguay.



The commitments included in the CPTPP can be divided into
two main areas:



Market access: This area focuses on the extent to
     which each CPTPP Party will reduce tariffs, open its services markets,
     relax visa requirements for business travelers, and similar matters. Each CPTPP
     Party has defined its own set of commitments specified in Schedules. Some
     commitments apply universally to all Parties, while others are limited to
     specific CPTPP Parties.



Rules: These pertain to various aspects, such
     as the establishment of new food safety regulations or the permissibility
     of data transfers among CPTPP Parties. These rules apply to all CPTPP Parties,
     including any prospective new members that may join in the future.



The CPTPP aims for comprehensive tariff liberalisation
among its Parties, with only a few highly sensitive sectors retaining tariffs.
For example, Japan maintained tariffs on rice, while Canada negotiated safeguards
for its dairy industry in the form of limited tariff-rate quotas. The agreement
establishes a unified set of rules of origin, allowing content from any CPTPP Party
to be combined or “cumulated”, which means that, if a product requires a
minimum of 70% “CPTPP content” to qualify for preferential tariffs, that
70% can be sourced from any combination of CPTPP Parties.



The emerging opportunities from the
expansion of the CPTPP to the UK



The UK’s accession to the CPTPP is a major milestone for
international trade, presenting important trade opportunities for CPTPP Parties
like Malaysia. Notably, investments by UK companies in Malaysia have the
potential to strengthen bilateral trade relations and foster economic growth
for both countries.[1] One of the
key benefits for Malaysia of the UK joining the CPTPP will be the elimination
of tariffs on palm oil imports, which currently amount to up to 12%, depending
on the specific tariff line. This may provide an important boost to palm oil producers
and exporters based in Malaysia. Malaysia is a major global player when it
comes to sustainable palm oil production and exports, holding approximately 25%
of the global market share, while Indonesia accounts for 60% of the global
supply. 



Palm oil is considered to be the most cost-effective and
environmentally beneficial vegetable oil due to its high productivity per acre
compared to other vegetable oils. With closer relations within the CPTPP, UK
research institutions could collaborate with Malaysia’s producers to further enhance
the industry’s sustainability and explore advancements in yield improvement, by-product
generation, and other aspects. Malaysia has significant growth potential and
increased palm oil production and efficiencies would further stimulate economic
development in the country.



As the CPTPP provides for the removal of tariffs
and other trade barriers among its Parties, being a Party to the CPTPP provides
Malaysia with a significant competitive advantage in the markets of the other
Parties, including in relation to Indonesia, which is not a CPTPP Party. By
granting preferential treatment to each other’s goods and services, the CPTPP
creates a more favourable trading environment, giving CPTPP Parties a
competitive edge over countries outside of the CPTPP by making their exports
more price-competitive in the markets of other CPTPP Parties.



This preferential access allows businesses
from CPTPP Parties to reach new consumers, expand market share, and increase
their competitiveness in the markets of the other Parties. The CPTPP also
promotes a greater degree of supply chain integration among the Parties, which
encourages businesses to establish regional value chains and production
networks, benefitting from cost efficiencies, specialisation, and economies of
scale. Generally, preferential trade agreements (PTAs) like the CPTPP also lead
to “trade diversion”, which occurs when Parties to a trade agreement
shift their imports from countries outside of the Agreement to fellow PTA
parties. This trade diversion effect delivered by the CPTPP can result in
increased market share and trade opportunities for Malaysia.



The 2022 Annual Progress Report for the UK Roundtable on
Sourcing Sustainable Palm Oil published by Experts in Sustainable Forest
& Agricultural Advice (EFECA) notes that, over the years, the UK
has made significant progress in the sourcing of sustainable palm and palm
kernel oil.[2] The Report
indicates that the proportion of UK imports of these oils that can be
classified as “certified sustainable” had increased from 16% in 2010 to
72% in 2021. The remaining imports are likely sourced through other forms of
assurance, such as policies adhering to No Deforestation, no Peatland, and no
Exploitation (NDPE) standards. There has also been notable advancement in
transitioning to segregated supply chains, with approximately 80% of imports
covered in the report certified under a segregated supply chain model of the
Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).



However, the Report explains that there are still areas of
improvement with respect to the UK market. Challenges related to traceability
in complex derivative and by-product supply chains persist in the home and
personal care, as well as in the animal feed, sectors. The Report indicates
that, in order to address these gaps, partnerships with initiatives in palm
oil-producing countries should be pursued. The UK represents a fraction of around
0.5% of global palm oil consumption and the Report concludes that the UK’s most
significant impact lies in fostering a collective effort to raise the overall
production standards across global supply chains. Importantly, with respect to the
Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) Certification Scheme, the Report notes
that it “covers almost all of Malaysia’s production base, with the total
MSPO-certified area in Malaysia increasing considerably between July 2020 and
July 2021 from 5.9 million ha to 6.66 million ha, representing 97% of its
production area”, while noting that the Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil
(ISPO)certification was “further behind in terms of this proportion”.



With respect to the expected impacts of the UK’s tariff removal
for Malaysian palm oil, the UK’s Agriculture and Horticulture Development
Board (AHDB), the levy board that represents UK farmers, growers, and
others in the supply chain, noted that economic data for the period from 2015
to 2022 showed that the UK’s imports of palm oil from Malaysia have been
relatively constant. On average, Malaysia accounted for 15% of palm oil
imports’ origin into the UK, given that the UK also sources palm oil from Indonesia
and Papua New Guinea. Notably, according to the AHDB, given the overall
cost-effectiveness of palm oil vis-à-vis other vegetable oils and given that the
demand for palm oil is not solely price-driven, the removal of tariffs would
not necessarily be translated into increased demand by UK’s consumers.[3] Still, the
tariff liberalisation for palm oil certainly creates an important competitive
advantage for Malaysian palm oil vis-à-vis its competitors in Indonesia, Papua New
Guinea, and Latin American palm oil-producing countries. 



The bigger picture



Negotiations and dialogue, as opposed to
trade wars, tit-for-tat actions, and unilateral decisions, serve as the more
promising means to achieve commercially relevant outcomes through the exchange
of ideas, interests, and concerns among multiple parties that aim to achieve win-win
outcomes where all sides benefit. Negotiated outcomes also deliver much greater
stability and predictability in the global business environment through the
establishment of clear rules and obligations, allowing businesses to plan
investments and make strategic decisions in the long term.



As the example of the CPTPP shows, Malaysia would significantly
benefit from such an approach and from the further negotiation of PTAs with key
trading partners, such as the EU. This would contribute to a level playing
field, competitive commercial advantages, and potential for important
negotiated solutions regarding certain EU non-tariff measures and barriers. A dedicated
PTA would provide Malaysia not only with improved market access to the EU, but
the negotiation of preferential terms of market access could reduce the impact
of non-tariff barriers established by the plethora of the EU’s recent
regulatory initiatives impacting global supply chains, including palm oil when
it comes to sustainability, forced labour, and deforestation. For instance, a preferential
trade agreement could involve the harmonisation or mutual recognition of certain
regulatory standards and technical requirements, such as those related to
sustainability, which would help reduce trade barriers arising from divergent
regulatory frameworks, ensuring smoother trade flows and facilitating market
entry for Malaysia’s businesses. Commitments to enhanced regulatory cooperation
would also allow Malaysia to play a more active role in the EU’s legislative
debate. 



Sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to
trade, and intellectual property rights can have a significant impact on trade
relations, and a PTA with the EU could provide a platform for both Malaysia and
the EU to engage in discussions to seek greater transparency, regulatory
cooperation, and the removal of unnecessary and costly trade barriers. The
alignment of regulations and streamlined procedures between the EU and Malaysia
would lead to increased export opportunities, improved productivity, and
overall economic growth for Malaysia.



Being a Party to the CPTPP helps Malaysia to integrate into
both regional and global value chains and the UK’s accession further manifests
this benefit. By aligning regulations and standards with CPTPP partners,
Malaysia enhances its position as a preferred investment and manufacturing hub.
This sort of integration with other trading partners, notably the EU, whose
regulatory approach often inspires other jurisdictions, would also facilitate
greater economic cooperation, technology transfer, and knowledge sharing,
contributing to Malaysia’s overall development and competitiveness. In simple
terms, engaging in dialogue and negotiations with its key trading partners and
ultimately agreeing to a PTA such as the EU-Malaysia FTA would allow Malaysia
to address both tariff and non-tariff issues, leading to increased trade,
economic growth, and prosperity, including Malaysia’s palm oil industry.



The example of the commercial opportunities achieved by Malaysia with the UK through the latter’s CPTPP accession negotiations is a testament to the fact that, even with the EU, the solution to the current problems rests in well-executed negotiations based on a sound strategy.

31,"Surya Prakash Mahapatra wields a wooden hammer and chisel on a log with the confidence of a master carver. Dressed in a red T-shirt and black shorts, the 11-year-old sweats as he carves along the chalk outlines of flowers and animals on the log under the watchful eye of two experienced rupakar servitors (woodcarvers). The class 7 student has been learning woodcarving since he was just 5.

Surya’s “school” is located in the Ratha Khala, barely 500 metres from the 12th century Jagannath Temple in Puri, where three breathtaking chariots used in Puri’s annual Rath Yatra are cut, carved, chiselled, painted, polished and assembled each year — all manually — and his teachers are his father and grandfather.

Tuesday’s yatra expects to see the arrival of nearly 15 lakh devotees from across the globe. Over 150 pairs of hands belonging to labourers, carpenters, artists, painters, etc., worked in tandem to shape over 800 logs into three magnificent chariots by working for 12 hours a day from Akshaya Tritiya onwards, nearly two months before the much-awaited event.

The yatra, which takes place on the second day of the Odia month of Ashadh Shukla Tithi, sees sibling deities — Lord Balabhadra, Goddess Subhadra and Lord Jagannath — embark on a 3-km journey to their ‘aunt’s’ residence at the Gundicha Temple in three gigantic chariots pulled by devotees with the help of 250-feet long ropes made using coconut fibres. The Bahuda Yatra, which marks their return home, will be celebrated with the same fervour on June 28.

The Taladhwaja Rath for Lord Balabhadra, the Darpadalan Rath for Goddess Subhadra and the Nandighosa Rath for Lord Jagannath each have their own colours, height, diameter, wooden horses, guardian deities and even charioteers. Grand engineering marvels, these raths are over 40 feet tall and have at least 12 wheels each. They are made from wood of local trees like fasi, dhaura, simili and asana. The wood is obtained from the Nayagarh forest each year.

These talented rupakar servitors, who don’t have any formal education in woodcarving or use modern machinery or equipment, rely on the wisdom passed down by their ancestors for this “hereditary service”. Ramesh Mahapatra, whose brother Bijay Mohapatra is the biswakarma (chief carpenter) of the Nandighosa Rath, said, “We don’t use measuring tapes or units like feet and inches. Instead, we use units like haat (hand size), anguli (finger size) and a stick as units of measurements. One stick equals one haat and 25 angulis equal one haat.”

The conversation is cut short due to confusion over the size of a log. Intervening swiftly, Ramesh uses the stick passed down to him by his father to resolve the matter.

“Chariot construction work usually starts when Odisha schools go on summer vacation or have morning school (from 7-11 am due to the heat). Just like I started learning from my elders 40 years ago, I wanted my son to learn wood carving too. So I made sure he started young,” Panchanan Mahapatra, Surya’s 46-year-old father, told The Indian Express.

Stating that he hopes Surya relocates to other cities for higher studies, better jobs and higher income, Panchanan added, “We consider this work a service to Lord Jagannath. It is a legacy from our ancestors and we want our children to continue this tradition.”

Besides birds, animals and flowers, rupakar servitors also carve parsva debatas (guardian deities), which are affixed on the chariots. The maharanas (carpenters), bhois (labourers), karatias (wood cutters), chitrakars (painters), kamaras (ironsmith) and others also play an important role in preparing for the yatra. The bhoi sevayats play a critical role in the entire process, from the supply of labourers for the construction of the chariots to carrying large logs to the Ratha Khala. The bhoi sevayats also help apply brakes on the chariots on the day of the yatra. As the chariots near completion, the bhoi sevayats carry the wooden horses and other sculptures that are fixed on the chariots.

Alok Bhoi, a 21-year-old graduate who has been helping his father at the Ratha Khala since the past decade as a bhoi sevayat, said, “I want to go outside Puri for my career, but this work is sacred for me. I want to continue doing it.”

Balakrushna Maharana, a 46-year-old maharana sevayat who supervises the construction of the Taladhwaja Rath, said he feels privileged to be a part of the process. “I have seen three generations of my family engaged in this service. I encourage my son, who is in class 7, to learn these techniques too,” said Balakrushna, who works as a carpenter and a Patachitra painter after the yatra.

Once the chariots are assembled, around 20 chitrakar sevayats (artists) work extra hours for two weeks before the yatra to paint the statues of the guardian deities affixed on each chariot.

Though many servitors said they don’t do this service for the money, the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA) pays remuneration ranging from Rs 400 to Rs 1,200 per day. The total budget for the 2022-23 yatra was Rs 14.76 crore, while the budget for 2023-24 is estimated to be Rs 16.62 crore. The budget includes the cost of chariot construction, security, ceremonies, temple beautification, etc. The logs are not included in the total budget since they are supplied by the state government .

A temple official said, “The erstwhile kings of Puri (the Gajapatis who are known as the first servitors) supervised the construction of the chariots and the supply of wood till 1954. With the implementation of the Jagannath Temple Act in 1954, the state forest and environment departments started supplying wood from the forests in Nayagarh district, which was a part of the undivided Puri district.”

On the day of the yatra, Puri Gajapati Dibyasingha Deb arrives in a palanquin from his palace, which is 500 metres from the temple, in a ceremonial procession. He conducts the chhera panhara rituals, as part of which he sweeps the floor of the chariot with a golden broom.

After the yatra, the SJTA sells parts of the chariots — wheels for Rs 50,000 and axles for Rs 15,000 per piece.

32,"Between April and May 2003, the Indian Army carried out Operation Sarp Vinash in the hilly heights of Poonch to liberate Hilkaka – a hamlet nestled high up in the mountains of Surankote tehsil — from militants who had established a parallel state on those heights.

The operation marked a turning point against cross-border militancy in the area, and led to nearly two decades of peace in Poonch district and neighbouring Rajouri, both located along the Line of Control with Pakistan.

Now, in the 20th anniversary year of the Hilkaka operation, as the larger Jammu region faces an uptick in militant attacks – 10 soldiers were killed in two militant ambushes in the Rajouri-Poonch area in April and May this year, making this one of the deadliest years for the forces — the hero of Hilkaka, Tahir Fazal Hussain, a Gujar resident of the nearby Marrah village who led the civilian uprising against militant groups in the area, has a piece of advice for the government: get the local people on your side.

Overlooking the slopes of Hilkaka, near a memorial honouring soldiers and civilians who laid down their lives in battles against militants between 2002 and 2004, Hussain, now in his fifties and wearing an olive green salwar, a long full-sleeved shirt, and a baseball cap, tells The Indian Express, “My guess is that there are probably no more than 18 militants roaming the area, and perhaps only six are hardcore fighters. If we can’t handle these guys, then what is the point of the Rafales we just bought from France, or for that matter all our tanks, and firepower? If the local people are not on your side, then all that is useless, isn’t it?”

The memorial – at the entrance of the Kulali Army camp, which came up after the Hilkaka operation — has two life-size statues: one of a soldier and, the other, of Hussain.

Hussain says the government, intelligence agencies, and the forces are not reaching out to locals the way officials had done two decades ago. “Fighting is just two per cent of the job. Information is everything. And the (intelligence) agencies are not getting the right information because they are not making the effort to tap the right sources, and their approach to people is all wrong,” Hussain says.

Hussain, however, doesn’t fear a return to the time when Surankote had become a haven of Pakistani militants, who built shelters, a two-storeyed hospital and amassed stores to last months. That’s because, he says, “the Gujar remains a loyal Indian”.

He then strikes a note of caution – “but there are people in the community who are vulnerable to the enemy for various reasons”.

One of the reasons for this vulnerability, he says, is the “anti-Muslim sentiment that has taken hold of the country”, something the enemy is exploiting. “They (the enemy) are telling people here that the Hindutva guys will reconvert all Muslims here into Hindus,” he says.

Second, the proposed inclusion of the Pahadi community in the Scheduled Tribes category — a draft legislation now awaits parliamentary approval — has “created anger in the (Gujjar) community”, he says, adding that he himself led a march from his village against the government’s move.

And third, people were falling for the money the enemy was offering. “If we want to earn money now, these guys can send us to Paris. That’s how much they are offering. They are paying by the hour,” he says.

Drug smuggling is a huge source of money for the militants, Hussain says, adding, “It’s at the root of all the problems. In some villages along the border, you can get Pakistan telecom signals. Some people who fall prey to the militants are given SIMs, all they have to do is keep their phones with that SIM at a pre-arranged place. The drone follows the signals and drops the contraband. After that, the guy’s job is just to drop it off at the next point, and then someone else transports it further to the dealer.”

Hussain recalls how he returned from Saudi Arabia in June 2002, leaving behind his job as a supervisor at a marble workshop where he earned Rs 50,000 a month, to avenge the death of his brother at the hands of the Lashkar-e-Toiba militants.

The incident, he says, was triggered by the rape of a woman in the village, allegedly by militants. Hussain says his brother, a religious leader in the village, confronted the LeT commanders about the rape. The rapist was identified by the victim and later killed, but Hussain says that for the militants, his brother became a marked man — he was beaten to death with sticks.

Hussain soon joined the Village Defence Committee (VDC) as a special police officer (SPO) for Rs 1,500 a month. “I knew I needed an AK 47 to take on the militants; without becoming an SPO, I could not get an AK,” he says, recalling that within a month of returning home, he shot dead the militant who led the attack on his brother.

Soon after, he and others in the village formed the “Pir Panjal Scouts” under the banner of “Jammu Peace Mission”. It worked alongside the J&K Police and the Army. Many village men who worked alongside Hussain in Saudi Arabia responded to his call and returned home to take part in the fight. A VDC was formed with a women’s wing, with Hussain’s wife Munira Begum its commander.

“We villagers fought shoulder to shoulder with the Army,” he says. The Hilkaka operation followed in April-May the following year.

“The village lost 14 fighters in those two-three years, but we killed over a 100 militants 2002 onwards, and continue to eliminate them even after the main operation ended in May 2003 (65 is the official number of militants killed in Operation Sarp Vinash). Only 87 bodies of the militants were found, and I stood adamant that the bodies of 14 Lashkar militants should not be given a burial after the zulm (atrocity) they had carried out in my village. I told the authorities that I did not care if their corpses were eaten by dogs, but they should not find their final resting place in my Jammu & Kashmir,” he said. In all, 45 villagers in Marrah, Kulali and Hilkaka were killed by the militants between 2002-2004.

Hussain says he recently went to Gursain, the village that came under the scanner after the militant ambush on the truck at Bhatta Durian that killed five soldiers, to speak to the villagers there.

“One guy told me, Tahir, you put us on a pedestal and took away the ladders. I asked them, ‘Tumhara dimagh kharab ho gaya hai (have you lost your mind)? If you have to live here, you have to remain loyal to this country. Hindustan hi sabse badhi seedi hai tumhare liye. Governments may come and go, but Hindustan kahin nahin ja raha (India will stay)’,” says Hussain.","As Jammu sees terror push, hero of Hilkaka Tahir Fazal Hussain, a Gujar resident of the nearby Marrah village who led the civilian uprising against militant groups in the area, has a piece of advice for the government: get the local people on your side.

He also believes that anti-Muslim sentiment in the region is taking hold of the country and that people are falling for the money the enemy is offering.

33,"The slow progression of the monsoon in India has caused significant delays in the sowing of crucial kharif crops such as paddy, oilseeds, and pulses. With rainfall arriving late in Kerala and the country experiencing deficient precipitation overall, concerns are mounting that El Nino could further suppress the much-needed rains.

Santosh Jhanwar, the Chief Executive of Agriwatch, a farm research firm working with around half a million farmers, noted that there is currently a lag of 10-12 days in sowing across major agricultural regions. Any further delay in the monsoon's progress will result in lower crop yields. Presently, the country is facing a rainfall deficiency of 37%. The monsoon arrived in Kerala on June 8, which is later than the normal onset date of June 1.

Sowing of pulses typically begins only four to five days after the monsoon arrives, as farmers require 2-2.5 inches of water in their fields. However, Suresh Agarwal, President of the All India Dal Mill Association, highlighted that due to the significant rainfall deficiency, soil moisture levels are depleting.

Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency, has issued a ""dismal"" outlook for rainfall in the core agricultural zone until the first week of July. This period is crucial for sowing or preparing the fields for the kharif season. Skymet warned that the agricultural heartland appears cracked and parched.

One of the crops likely to be severely affected is soybean, which requires a substantial amount of water. Rahul Chauhan, Director of iGrain, an agri-research firm, stated that there might be a lower acreage for soybean cultivation this year. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported that the monsoon has remained stagnant in several regions, including Ratnagiri, Koppal, Puttaparthi, and Sriharikota in the south, as well as Malda and Forbesganj in the east.

Despite the onset of El Nino, which can disrupt global rainfall patterns, the IMD predicts a normal monsoon for this year. Rainfall deficiencies are particularly pronounced in central India, with a shortfall of 55%, and in the southern peninsula, with a deficit of 61%. The east and northeast zones are experiencing a 23% rainfall deficiency.

Following the rainfall brought by Cyclone Biparjoy over parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan, the deficiency in northwestern India has reduced.","The slow progression of the monsoon in India has caused significant delays in the sowing of crucial kharif crops such as paddy, oilseeds, and pulses.

34,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. — Illinois dairy farmers are committed to building up communities experiencing food insecurity.

Recognizing the hardships many families are facing, the Illinois Milk Producers Association donated nearly 10,000 pounds of milk, including lactose-free, between two local food banks.

“We know that many families are struggling with food insecurity amid rising prices at the grocery store,” said Don Mackinson, IMPA president. “Everyone deserves access to fresh, nutritious food, which is why Illinois dairy farmers wanted to find a new way to support our communities.”

IMPA donated 2,088 half-gallon containers of milk, and 396 half-gallon containers of lactose-free milk, to the Central and Eastern Illinois Foodbanks.

The donation was made in partnership with Prairie Farms, Illinois Corn Growers Association and Illinois Soybean Association.

Tasha Bunting, IMPA executive director, said the donation coincided with the start of June Dairy Month, a time when dairy farmers and the dairy industry are celebrated.

“Dairy Month is an opportunity to share not only what our dairy farmers are doing and the challenges they’re facing, but also fund things like dairy recipes and dairy consumption,” Bunting said.

“This year, we’ve started a new program to help some of those families in need of dairy products, especially during a time when inflation is such a challenge for many.”

Prairie Farms delivered the donations to the Central Illinois Foodbank in Springfield and the Eastern Illinois Foodbank in Urbana on June 6.

“Central Illinois Foodbank is excited to work with great partners to feed our neighbors healthy and nutritious foods. Thanks to a community effort from Illinois Milk Producers Association, Illinois Corn Growers Association, Illinois Soybean Association and Prairie Farms, our neighbors have greater access to dairy,” said Pam Molitoris, Central Illinois Foodbank executive director.

“Families facing hunger have to make unthinkable choices every day. When you are choosing between making rent and putting food on the table, dietary restrictions may be put aside. A lactose-free milk option provides families with the opportunity to enjoy nutritious alternatives.”

Illinois Department of Agriculture Director Jerry Costello II joined IMPA and the Central Illinois Foodbank to acknowledge the role the dairy industry plays in Illinois’ economy.

“There are about 400 dairy farmers in the state of Illinois, and I think anybody who’s in or around agriculture knows the hours and work that goes into dairy farming is second to none,” Costello said.

“It is something that is very physically and mentally exhausting. We’re also just coming off of May, which is mental health month. We have a Farm Family Resource Initiative Helpline — 833-FarmSOS — for all those folks in agriculture that may be experiencing stresses.”","The Illinois Milk Producers Association (IMPA) has donated nearly 10,000 pounds of milk to two local food banks in an effort to help families experiencing food insecurity.

36,"Researchers found Leaf arrangements in the earliest plants differ from those in most modern plants, casting doubt on a long-held theory about the origins of a well-known mathematical pattern found in nature. The study was published in the journal, 'Science.'

According to the findings, the arrangement of leaves into distinctive spirals, which is common in nature today, was not common in the most ancient land plants that first populated the earth's surface. Instead, the ancient plants were discovered to have a different type of spiral. This contradicts a long-held theory about the evolution of plant leaf spirals, which suggested that they evolved along two distinct evolutionary paths.

Spirals are common in nature, whether they are the vast swirls of a hurricane or the intricate spirals of the DNA double-helix, and most can be described by the famous mathematical series the Fibonacci sequence. Named after the Italian mathematician, Leonardo Fibonacci, this sequence forms the basis of many of nature's most efficient and stunning patterns.

Spirals are common in plants, with Fibonacci spirals making up over 90 per cent of the spirals. Sunflower heads, pinecones, pineapples and succulent houseplants all include these distinctive spirals in their flower petals, leaves or seeds. Why Fibonacci spirals, also known as nature's secret code, are so common in plants has perplexed scientists for centuries, but their evolutionary origin has been largely overlooked.

Based on their widespread distribution it has long been assumed that Fibonacci spirals were an ancient feature that evolved in the earliest land plants and became highly conserved in plants. However, an international team led by the University of Edinburgh has overthrown this theory with the discovery of non-Fibonacci spirals in a 407-million-year-old plant fossil.

Using digital reconstruction techniques the researchers produced the first 3D models of leafy shoots in the fossil clubmoss Asteroxylon mackiei - a member of the earliest group of leafy plants. The exceptionally preserved fossil was found in the famous fossil site the Rhynie chert, a Scottish sedimentary deposit near the Aberdeenshire village of Rhynie.

The site contains evidence of some of the planet's earliest ecosystems - when land plants first evolved and gradually started to cover the earth's rocky surface making it habitable. The findings revealed that leaves and reproductive structures in Asteroxylon mackiei, were most commonly arranged in non-Fibonacci spirals that are rare in plants today.

This transforms scientists understanding of Fibonacci spirals in land plants. It indicates that non-Fibonacci spirals were common in ancient clubmosses and that the evolution of leaf spirals diverged into two separate paths. The leaves of ancient clubmosses had an entirely distinct evolutionary history from the other major groups of plants today such as ferns, conifers and flowering plants.

The team created the 3D model of Asteroxylon mackiei, which has been extinct for over 400 million years, by working with digital artist Matt Humpage, using digital rendering and 3D printing. The research, published in the journal Science, was funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), The Royal Society and the German Research Foundation.

The study also involved researchers from, University College Cork, Ireland, University Munster, Germany and Northern Rogue Studios, UK. Dr Sandy Hetherington, an evolutionary palaeobiologist and the project's lead at the University of Edinburgh, said:

""Our model of Asteroxylon mackiei lets us examine leaf arrangement in 3D for the first time. The technology to 3D print a 407-million-year-old plant fossils and hold it in your hand is really incredible. ""Our findings give a new perspective on the evolution of Fibonacci spirals in plants.""

Holly-Anne Turner, who worked on the project as an undergraduate student at the University of Edinburgh and is the first author of the study, said: ""The clubmoss Asteroxylon mackiei is one of the earliest examples of a plant with leaves in the fossil record.

""Using these reconstructions we have been able to track individual spirals of leaves around the stems of these 407 million-year-old fossil plants. Our analysis of leaf arrangement in Asteroxylon shows that very early clubmosses developed non-Fibonacci spiral patterns.""","Researchers from the University of Edinburgh have discovered that leaf arrangements in the earliest plants differ from those in most modern plants, casting doubt on a long-held theory about the origins of a well-known mathematical pattern found in nature.

37,"Duty on sunseed exports led to an increase in sunflower oil production in Kazakhstan

Kazakhstan’s export duty on sunflower seeds of 20%, but not less than EUR 100 per ton, introduced in early 2023, helped provide local oil extraction companies with raw materials.

According to the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Kazakhstan Yerbol Karashukeyev, oil production in the country has increased by 62% since the introduction of restrictive measures, and prices on the domestic market have decreased by more than 8% in 2023.

“At the same time, the export of sunflower oil last year amounted to 229.4 thsd tonnes, which is 1.7 times more than in 2021,” the report says.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, there are 70 enterprises producing vegetable oils in Kazakhstan. The supply of these products to the domestic market is 141%.

38,"Farmers in the southern Brazilian state of Parana have started harvesting their 2022/23 safrinha corn. The early harvest pace is less than 1% and it is being slowed by wet weather. The Department of Rural Economics reported that as of earlier this week, the safrinha corn was 1% in vegetative development, 21% pollinating, 69% filling grain, and 9% mature. The corn is rated 2% poor, 14% average, and 84% good.

The corn in the southern and western regions of the state is the most mature, while the corn in the northern parts of the state is the least mature.

In the region of Londrina in northern Parana, wet weather during the soybean harvest delayed the planting of the safrinha corn by approximately two weeks. After the safrinha corn was planted, the weather turned dryer, negatively impacting the corn development. According to the director of the Rural Union of Londrina, safrinha corn yields are normally in the range of 100 to 120 sacks per hectare (95 to 114 bu/ac), but this year the yields should be in the range of 70 to 80 sacks per hectare (67 to 76 bu/ac).

Over the last several weeks, rainfall has returned to northern Parana which should help the later developing corn, but the crop needs to stay frost-free for two more months to insure its full yield potential.","Farmers in the southern Brazilian state of Parana have started harvesting their 2022/23 safrinha corn, which is 1% in vegetative development, 21% pollinating, 69% filling grain, and 9% mature.

The safrinha production, which is planted after soybeans are harvested, represents about 76% of Brazil’s total corn production.

The safrinha corn harvest in the state is just getting underway and a lack of storage space may force farmers to sell their corn despite disappointing corn prices. The lack of storage is due to farmers still holding a significant portion of their record 2022/23 soybean crop.

40,"GIWA Crop Report: WA’s grain growing season ‘transformed’ and ‘turned around dramatically’ by rainfall

Grain crops showing moisture stress just weeks ago have been ‘transformed’ by recent rainfall across Western Australia, boosting the State’s grain production potential to average to above-average.

Falls of up to 100mm this month have given farmers the seasonal break they were hoping for after almost no rainfall since the start of the year caused them to seed crops dry.

The Grain Industry Association of WA this month released its crop report for June, revealing that the State’s crop potential had “turned around dramatically” in a period of about four days.

Crop reporter Michael Lamond, an agronomist at York, said farmers in the northern third of the grain growing regions had been “looking down the barrel” of a very poor year until earlier this month.

“Emerged crops were showing signs of moisture stress and much of the northern and southern grain belt were dusty and brown,” he said.

“This has since changed, with several good falls… in some cases exceeding the average rainfall for the whole of June.”

The year to date rainfall for the whole State – excluding some eastern edges of the grain belt – are now at levels where reasonable tonnages of production were possible.

WA grain farmers have planted 8.53 million hectares of crop this year, with the Kwinana Zone (which includes two areas, north and south) leading the way with 4.25 million hectares.

Comparatively, farmers in the Albany Port Zone have planted 1.70Mt, those in the Geraldton Port Zone 1.36Mt and the Esperance Port Zone 1.21Mt.

Wheat is still the biggest crop in WA, with 4.63 million hectares going into the ground across the grain growing regions, followed by canola at 1.8 million hectares, barley at 1.54 million hectares, lupins at 260,000 hectares, oats at 215,000ha and pules at 40,000ha.

While rain early in June has been significant, climate models continue to agree that below-normal rain is more likely between July and September for most of Australia – with the likelihood of an El Nino event developing in the Pacific Ocean increasing.

Mr Lamond said the entire Kwinana South Zone and the southern portion of the Kwinana North East zone were now in nearly as good a shape as this time last year, with the latter in a race for average grain potential.

Those in the Kwinana North area have experienced a turnaround after doubling their year to date rainfall in the space of a week, with some late paddocks now expected to be planted.

“Patchy, early-sown canola crops are expected to recover while pasture paddocks now have a tinge of green,” Mr Lamond said.

“A lot of farmers with livestock were sweating on the rain and were relieved their extra sheep would have paddock feed.”

The entire Kwinana South zone has been “looking brilliant”, with emerged crops “freshened”.

“The country looks brilliant east to west, and is unusually consistent from Meckering through to Merredin,” Mr Lamond said.

“There is still a bit of patchwork of paddocks across the zone… but the rain was still early enough to give the un-emerged crops a chance of good grain yield potential.”

Farmers were now facing an “conundrum” of how to tackle weed control, with a flush expected.

Crops in the southern part of the region are looking good after the rain, with those given nitrogen top-ups really “taking off”, Mr Lamond said.

Patchy canola crops are expected to improve and pastures will now be able to support extra sheep on-farm, but feed will still be tight until August.

About 30 per cent of the southern part of the Zone is still to be sown.

Farmers in the western parts of the Albany Port Zone are finding their crops have “gone from a feather duster to a rooster” in four days, Mr Lamond said.

“Most of the region has had between 80 to 110mm of rain in the last week, completely transforming the outlook for the region,” he said.

“Crops have come to life and the non-existent pastures have greened up within days of the rain.”

It’s a different story in the west and southern portion of the Albany Port Zone, where crops are falling behind in growth stages compared to this time last year – with less subsoil moisture reserves.

The Lakes district is well behind where it was last year, with the most crops emerging on the recent rains.

“It is not too for average grain yield potential to be achieved,” Mr Lamond said.

“But frost will have a greater impact over a wider area.”

Farmers near Esperance were in “desperate need of the recent rains”, with crops looking patchy and some drier areas unfortunately missing out once again – including Cascade and Salmon Gums.

The subsoil moisture reserves from rain around harvest are still there, and the later sown and emerged crops will now be able to get their roots down into it. The coastal areas are very good and not too wet as yet.

Large areas of country were sown on the angle to get crops up in the drying profile, with more farmers planting seed deeper than ever before.

Weed control in the canola paddocks has been challenging as the crops have a large range of growth stages due to the staggered emergence following planting.

A lot of nitrogen went out ahead of the rains, and growers will now be concentrating on getting rid of the flush of weeds that are expected to germinate now the country is wet.

Some country has needed double baiting for mice, although this has mainly been in barley stubbles or where there was delayed harvest from moisture or hail damage.

Farmers in the Geraldton Port Zone are also in the running for average grain yield potential, Mr Lamond said, but they would need plentiful winter rain for this to occur.

Some crops have failed to emerge, while other parts needed re-seeding after a lack of rain.

The north-eastern and eastern fringe missed out on the good falls of rain, and some of the light country in the northern areas was starting to blow with little coverage.

Very few lupins have been planted in the region this year, and canola plantings have been significantly down over recent years, with cereals dominating most programs.

Many growers chased deep moisture, which has paid off as these crops have emerged with enough plants to give good yield potential.

The extra few weeks of growing season this has delivered is critical in the warmer northern portions of the grain belt.

This practice change of chasing deep moisture occurred over a large area of the state this year and while sowing deep is not without its own risks, this year it has paid off.

There is a big contrast in yield potential between those that did chase moisture and those that did not, and this could end up adding significant tonnes of grain to the 2023 WA total.","GIWA Crop Report: WA's grain growing season ‘transformed’ and ‘turned around dramatically’ by recent rainfall across Western Australia, boosting the State’s grain production potential to average to above-average.

41,"Palm Oil imports from Malaysia – a top global producer to Nigeria have surged by 353 per cent in the first four months of 2023 despite local players ramping up production, data from the Malaysian Palm Oil Council shows.

The Nigeria’s palm oil import from Malaysia increased to 92,961 metric tons (MT) between January-April 2023, from 20,513 MT in the corresponding period of 2022, indicating a 72,448 MT increase.

In 2022, the country imported 227,035 MT of palm oil from Malaysia.

Despite moves by the government, in listing crude palm oil alongside other 40 items restricted from forex access, and closing the Nigerian borders, oil palm imports into the country are still on the rise owing to the huge demand-supply gap, according to experts.

“Nigeria’s oil palm imports from Malaysia will continue to increase for the time being because our investment in the industry is still very insignificant,” managing director, Palmtrade and Commodities Development Nigeria Ltd, Henry Olatujoye, said according to reports by BusinessDay.

“We estimated that our local/domestic consumption is averaging 2.4 million tons in a year, and our first-class developers – Okomu, Presco, and others, do not annually produce up to 800,000 tons.","Palm Oil imports from Malaysia have surged by 353% in the first four months of 2023, despite local players ramping up production.

46,"Nina Karpynec, Clariant Adsorbents, head of sales, marketing and technical business development purification Americas, and Guido Appl, Clariant Adsorbents, head of sales, marketing and technical business development purification EMEA, outlines how the global company has fared in the past 12 months.
Can you outline how the past 12 months have been for Clariant Adsorbents? 
Guido: Last year continued to be another challenging year for the industry. In 2021, much like the year before, almost all the geographies and markets in which we operate were impacted by the global Covid-19 crisis. However, the business, last year, was more affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
This affected European and Middle East market dynamics more than Asia and the Americas, including lower market predictability and greater swings in the supply-demand balance, paired with the need to adjust purification steps to fluctuating crops and oil qualities.
In addition, we have been facing raw material shortages and labour challenges such as a lack of drivers, transportation or external service and maintenance staff.
Within our operations, the Clariant Adsorbents team successfully managed these challenges by leveraging our unrivaled network of mining and production sites across the globe and Europe, thus ensuring supply of adsorbents through this critical time.
Wherever we could, we accelerated our cost reduction programmes. I am particularly proud of the safety records we achieved and our sustainability initiatives.
We often go the extra mile to ensure maximum safety for our colleagues while living our strong commitment to our sustainability journey. Overall, these efforts resulted in very robust business growth last year.
12 months on, how has the hike in energy prices alongside the war in Ukraine impacted the Adsorbents/Purification business?  
Guido: Over the last 10 years, we in the Adsorbents team have worked diligently on optimising our operational costs and improving our mining, production and service footprint so were able to absorb a sizeable portion of cost increases.
However, last year we were challenged with sudden, unprecedented cost hikes that we had never experienced before at such scale and speed.
Other players in the value chain faced the same challenges. We had to increase prices across a wider product portfolio as a necessary step due to the cumulative impact of these raw material cost hikes; challenges in the availability of some additives; and rapid rises in energy, labour and logistics costs.
In addition, we strive to secure economics for our long-term sustainability investment path. The uncertainty of gas supply was the sword of Damocles across both industry and private households in large parts of Europe. In the short term, it was a threat that we could mitigate through our production network.
However, as said, we have been further accelerating and investing in our vital sustainability programmes, such as the expansion of our natural-drying capacities, of which we expect to harvest benefits in the years ahead.
Are there any new developments or partnerships in the pipeline at Clariant Adsorbents? 
Nina: As my colleague mentioned above, Clariant, as well as every employee of our Business Unit Adsorbents & Additives team, is committed to bringing our purpose of ‘Greater chemistry between people and planet’ to life.
Innovating for sustainability plays a crucial part in that. We are looking into reducing our own carbon footprint in operations (scope 1 and 2 emissions) via investing in digitalisation, natural drying and a reduction in the use of fossil fuels. We are also focusing on emissions along the value chain (scope 3) taking every effort to reduce the carbon footprint of our sales products, which will ultimately reduce the scope 3 emissions of our customers.
Soon, we will be able to measure those with our new automated and externally certified carbon footprint calculator.
At Business Unit Adsorbents & Additives, we produce speciality adsorbents under the brand name Tonsil® for the pretreatment of feedstock used in bio and renewable fuel production.
As the market is facing increasingly diverse and harder-to-treat feedstock, growing fluctuating impurities and conflicting specifications, we are further improving our portfolio to ensure an optimum balance between targeted impurity removal, filtration/throughput, and optimised processing costs.
We are also proud to have completed the acquisition of BASF’s Attapulgite business in Quincy, Florida.
North America is a strategic region for Clariant with numerous growth opportunities in the edible oil and renewable fuel markets.
With our expertise, and via this acquisition, we will increase our production capacity to meet the growing demand for renewable fuels whilst also maintaining our supply integrity to the edible oils market, more specifically by expanding our Tonsil® range.
Tonsil® adsorbents are a gold standard for efficient and sustainable oils and fats purification. The product range has been used successfully to remove impurities from crude oils and fats for more than 100 years and we are investing in keeping this tradition tag going in the coming decades.
What are the new growth areas that the company has identified? 
Nina: We are constantly improving our products and are focused on what customers’ desire.
Our adsorbents have been used for decades for edible oil purification as well as within the pretreatment of waste oils and fats for the production of renewable fuels and sustainable aviation fuels.
Within edible oils the current focus is to support safe products without harmful impurities like 3-MCPD, GE or even MOSH and MOAH.
Customers who use our adsorbents within pretreatment are focused on removing impurities and keeping a high throughput, including hard-to-treat feedstocks at optimised total cost of ownership – independent of the feedstock they are using. With our Tonsil and Tonsil RNF product range, we are able to fulfill these needs. Our commitment to these industries is also amplified by our most recent acquisition in the US, which expands our global footprint and production network even further.
It is also interesting to look beyond current applications and new emerging growth opportunities.
Circularity is a key area in which we focus our search for growth opportunities – as it represents an untapped value pool where we are doing something good for our environment at the same time.
Last autumn, we launched a new product portfolio for purifying pyrolysis oil derived from plastic waste.
This new portfolio, consisting of our Clariant adsorbents and HD max catalysts, answers the need for flexible and economic solutions to remove a wide range of contaminants regardless of process configuration and plastic waste feedstock – and ultimately achieve cracker compatible pyrolysis oil.
So, supporting a circular economy for plastics, but also challenging ourselves on what we can do in terms of reducing dosages of our adsorbents at high performance, reusing, or even recycling them is high on our agenda to innovate for sustainability.
For the pretreatment of biofuel feedstocks, we follow exactly where the market takes us. Wherever there is growth, we are easily able to serve it, thanks to our unrivaled footprint of mines and factories in Asia, Europe and the Americas for manufacturing Tonsil RNF, speciality adsorbents used in renewable fuel production.
Currently, we see strong growth in biofuels in Europe, Southeast Asia and North America – underpinned by long-term, sustainable growth drivers and supported by mandatory blending targets and incentives for low carbon fuels.
In addition, we expect another strong surge in growth from the increased adoption of sustainable aviation fuels.
Looking ahead to the next 12 months, what are the challenges that the Clariant Adsorbents Team faces? 
Guido and Nina: Current challenges include energy costs and potential uncertainty, availability of crops due to the war on Ukraine and global transportation/shipping choke points.
Following recent discussions on e-fuels in Europe, it is fair to say that a global alignment of regions is still missing and the risk of changing government policies and incentives is evident.
Major market challenges are the limitations and dynamically changing. Regarding feedstock availability, we are confident that with innovation and our large portfolio we can cope with these ongoing issues.
Additionally, we are investing in mines and capacities in key growth regions. A good example is our recently completed acquisition of BASF’s facility in Quincy, Florida, as mentioned above.

Stock market quotations for palm and soybean oil have been rising for 5 consecutive sessions, which is strengthening the demand for cheap Ukrainian sunflower oil, the prices of which recently fell to $670-680/t with delivery to the port, but rose to $700/t in a few days and even higher

Against the backdrop of rising sunflower oil prices, processors immediately raised the demand price for sunflower by 500-700 UAH/t to 14,000-14,500 UAH/t with delivery to the plant. In addition, sunflower prices were supported by the increase in demand prices for deliveries to the EU by $20-30/t, as well as a slight increase in the movement of ships through the grain corridor during the last week.

At the same time, the premium for high-oleic sunflower oil is only $40/ton. This shows that European buyers have not yet returned to the market.

According to Spike Brokers analysts, the asking prices are now:

The company’s experts note the oversaturation of offers in the German market, where most factories are supplied with raw materials until October-November, as well as significant volumes of Australian canola purchased by French processors. All this may lead to a decrease in rapeseed imports to Europe compared to the previous year. And low prices for rapeseed and rapeseed oil will restrain a possible rise in sunflower prices.

 India's stalled monsoon is likely to gain momentum in the next three to four days and could cover key rice, soybean, cotton and sugar cane growing region in the southern, central and western states, weather officials said on Tuesday.

This year, the formation of severe cyclone Biparjoy in the Arabian Sea delayed the onset of monsoon and restricted its progress to just a third of the country so far.

 Rains usually lash Kerala state, on India's southwest coast, from around June 1 and cover nearly half of the country by mid-June.

51,"New-crop soybean and corn prices in Chicago rose 4% on the day

In the USA, on June 19, the newly introduced Day of Emancipation of Slaves (Juneteenth) was celebrated, dedicated to the complete abolition of slavery in the country after the Civil War. Exchanges were working yesterday, but government agencies were not, because the weekly report on the harvest in the USA will be released today. On Monday, on news about the lack of precipitation in the US corn belt, speculators actively bought futures for soybeans and corn of the new crop, which led to a price increase of 3.8-4%.

On the Chicago stock exchange, futures rose in price yesterday:
• November soybean futures – by 3.8% to $493.2/t (+8.3% for the week),
• November corn futures – up 4% to $235.2/t (+9% for the week), which is above the psychological level of $6/bushel.

Quotations for soybeans and corn of the new harvest reached the level of the prices of the old harvest during the week. This shows that traders do not expect a significant harvest and a decrease in prices in the new season. According to forecasts, in the next 7 days, hot weather will prevail in the Midwest of the USA without significant precipitation.

In Ukraine, 4 million hectares were sown with corn (4.405 million hectares in 2022 and 5.14 million hectares in 2021), which slightly exceeds the plan. Despite the lack of precipitation in May and June, the crops are in good condition, as temperatures remain in the range of 23-25 o C.

Thanks to the slight activation of the grain corridor, the export of corn from Ukraine for June 1-17 amounted to 1.3 million tons of corn (2 million tons in May), and in total since the beginning of the season – 28.18 million tons (22.9 million tons last year). although the USDA estimated it at 27 million tons.

Demand prices for corn deliveries to the Danube ports remain at $173-175/t, but demand for deliveries to the Black Sea ports has increased, but prices there are only $160-165/t.

52,"Wall Street Journal writer Shannon Najmabadi reported on Saturday that, “Were this a normal mid-June morning, farmer Gary Millershaski would be looking out at waist-high fields of golden wheat almost ready to be harvested.

“Instead, he’s standing on a patch of mud, plucking at thin stalks of wheat that poke less than a foot out of the ground.

The Journal article explained that, “Around a third of the winter wheat grown nationwide is expected to be abandoned because it is uneconomical to harvest it this year. It is the highest rate of abandonment since 1917, exceeding the rate of wheat abandoned during the 1930s Dust Bowl.

“There is enough winter wheat for domestic consumption but volatile world market conditions have motivated U.S. mills to import wheat for flour, and the hit to U.S. farmers is acute.

“Abandoned fields will be left out for cattle to graze on, slashed and used as hay or killed with chemicals so farmers can collect on crop insurance and get new seeds into the ground.”

Najmabadi pointed out that, “Other Plains states like Oklahoma and Texas are expected to abandon wheat at even higher rates than Kansas.

“Kansas is the top winter-wheat producing state in the country. The U.S. is among the top five global exporters of wheat.”

“Recent downpours have helped revive some wilting wheat fields, particularly in the northwest part of the state, and offered hope that milo, corn and other crops being planted now will flourish.

“But for many places, the May and June rain is too late.”

Recall, however, that global wheat production is currently forecast at a record high level.

Dow Jones writer Yusuf Khan reported on Friday that, “Prices for wheat and corn have ticked higher over the last week since the explosion of the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine, however ample supplies and forecasts of record crops in the coming year are likely to keep prices in check, analysts say.”

Nonetheless, Kirk Maltais reported on Friday at The Wall Street Journal Online that, “Growing drought conditions across the U.S. Corn Belt this summer could take a bite out of what was expected to be a strong crop of corn, wheat and soybeans.”

Also on Friday, Reuters writer Julie Ingwersen reported that,

“The U.S. Department of Agriculture in May projected record-large U.S. corn and soybean harvests for 2023, but those targets are in jeopardy due to problematic weather as the summer growing season unfolds.”

In other news, Bloomberg writer Hallie Gu reported today that, “China is bracing for more extreme weather in coming days, bringing further risks to grain production across the nation.

“While high temperatures in northern areas could affect corn planting and harm wheat crops, heavy rains are likely to hurt rice in key southern growing regions, according to a report from the National Meteorological Center.”

And Reuters writer Dominique Patton reported today that, “China’s soybean imports from Brazil soared 40% in May, compared with a year-ago period, data showed on Tuesday, after big purchases of cheap beans arrived into Chinese ports.

“The world’s top buyer of soybeans imported 10.94 million metric tons of the oilseed from Brazil, its largest supplier, versus 7.79 million tons a year earlier, data from the General Administration of Customs showed.”","On Saturday, Wall Street Journal writer Shannon Najmabadi reported that around a third of the winter wheat grown nationwide is expected to be abandoned due to poor weather.

However, for the entire four-month season, the IMD has forecast an average amount of rainfall despite the formation of a possible El Nino weather phenomenon.

A strong El Nino, marked by a warming of the sea surface on the Pacific Ocean, can cause severe drought in Southeast Asia, India and Australia, while drenching other parts of the world such as the U.S. Midwest and Brazil with rain.

The emergence of a strong El Nino triggered back-to-back droughts in 2014 and 2015 for only the fourth time in over a century, pushing Indian farmers into extreme poverty.","India's stalled monsoon is likely to gain momentum in the next three to four days and could cover key rice, soybean, cotton and sugar cane growing regions in the southern, central and western states. The monsoon delivers nearly 70% of the rain needed to water its farms and recharge reservoirs and aquifers, and brings relief from the worst of the summer. The formation of severe cyclone Biparjoy in the Arabian Sea delayed the onset of monsoon and restricted its progress to just a third of the country so far. India has so far received 33% lower rainfall than normal, although in some states the deficit is as high as 95%.

54,"The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that India’s stalled monsoon is likely to gain momentum in the next 3-4 days and could cover key rice, soybean, cotton and sugarcane growing regions in the southern, central and western states.

In a release, the weather office said that heat wave conditions over East India and the adjoining areas is likely to abate gradually from today onwards and that conditions are favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon over some more parts of south Peninsular India, some parts of Odisha, some more parts of Gangetic West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar and East Uttar Pradesh during next 2-3 days. It also stated that very heavy to extremely heavy falls over Northeast India and Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim very likely will continue during next 2 days and decrease gradually thereafter. So far in June, India has received 33 per cent lower rainfall than normal, although in some states the deficit is as high as 95 per cent.

The agriculture sector is one of the worst-hit sectors during heatwaves in India, which significantly contributes to the economy. The sector accounts for around 16 per cent of the country’s GDP. The rising temperature and heat wave conditions also affect labour productivity, crop production and quality causing lower yields. Furthermore, the decline in agricultural output leads to a decline in farmers’ income, rise in food prices and inflation, affecting rural demand and consumption, and subsequently the overall economy.

According to the recent data, retail inflation declined to a 25-month low of 4.25 per cent in May mainly on favourable base effect and also on account of softening prices of food and fuel items. Food Inflation was at 2.91 per cent in May, lower than 3.84 per cent in April. The food basket accounts for nearly half of the CPI. In the event of poor monsoon and heat wave condition, the Indian economy could go back into the period of growing inflation.

Monsoon in India delivers nearly 70 per cent of the rain needed to water its farms and recharge reservoirs and aquifers, while bringing relief from the worst of the summer. The IMD has forecast below-average rains for June, with the monsoon expected to pick up in July, August and September.

The IMD said that light to moderate rainfall at most places with isolated heavy to extremely heavy rainfall is very likely over East Rajasthan on 19th June, isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall on 20th June and isolated heavy rainfall on 21st June. Further, light to moderate rainfall at most places is likely with isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall over Northwest Madhya Pradesh on 19th, 20th and 21st with extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places on 20th June. Light to moderate rainfall at most places is likely with isolated heavy rainfall over adjoining areas of Northeast Madhya Pradesh on 20th June. Light to moderate rainfall at most places is likely with isolated heavy rainfall over Southwest Uttar Pradesh on 20th and 21st June.","The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast that the stalled monsoon is likely to gain momentum in the next 3-4 days and could cover key rice, soybean, cotton and sugarcane growing regions in the southern, central and western states.

55,"India’s edible vegetable oil imports in May rose 3% from April to 1.053 million tonnes, with palm oil continuing to cede its import share to rivals sunflower and soybean oil, data from the Solvent Extractors Association of India (SEA) showed on Thursday.

The rise comes following a jump in imports of crude degummed soybean oil (CDSBO) and crude sunflower oil (CSFO), which rose by 21.5% and 18.5% on the month to 318,887 tonnes and 295,206 tonnes, respectively, reaching a total of 614,093 tonnes – 20% higher than April.

Argentina and Brazil were India’s top two suppliers for CDSBO in May at 197,444 and 104,940 tonnes respectively.

For CSFO, Argentina topped the supplier list again with 86,990 tonnes, while Russia placed second at 71,025 tonnes.

On the other hand, imports of palm oil – consisting of crude palm oil (CPO), refined bleached deodorised (RBD) palm olein and crude palm kernel oil (CPKO) – fell to its lowest level seen in 27 months to 439,173 tonnes –13.9% lower from April.

The dip continues from April where the spread between palm oil and soft oils narrowed considerably, prompting buyers to switch their purchases to soybean and sunflower oil.

Buyers were also heard cancelling more expensive palm oil cargoes purchased earlier and replacing them with soft oils.

Average CIF India prices for CPO were recorded at $938 per tonne for May, versus $957 per tonne for CSFO and $999 per tonne for CDSBO, according to SEA data.

The price spread ranged around $80-320 per tonne a year ago, with CPO priced lower.

Palm oil imports are expected to improve in June and July, with buying interest from India seen picking up as the spread between palm oil and its rivals widens further compared to earlier.

On a 2022-23 oil marketing year basis (November-October) however, palm oil imports remain dominant with total imports for the marketing year so far coming to 5.35 million tonnes – 59% of total edible oil imports and 43% higher from a year ago – while soft oil imports fell 2.7% on the year to 3.71 million tonnes.

Total edible oil imports for the first seven months of 2022-23 came to 9.06 million tonnes, 18% higher than a year ago.

For May, non-edible veg oil imports were at 4,998 mt, 82.5% lower from April and bringing the total veg oil imports for May to 1.06 million tonnes, 0.8% higher on the month but 0.3% lower than a year ago.

Total veg oil imports for 2022-23 so far came to 9.17 million tonnes, 18% higher than the same period last year.

Lastly, stock levels in India were pegged at 2.94 million tonnes as of June 1, 9.4% lower on the month.

On Tuesday, the Indian government announced a reduction in the base import duty of refined sunflower oil and soybean oil to the same level as refined palm oil at 12.5% from 17.5% previously with effect from June 15.

The move is seen as a way by the government to address inflation and keep edible oil prices in check, though market participants are skeptical if it would make any significant change in the composition of imports, given that India currently imports crude soft oils and zero refined soft oils with crude soft oil imports seen as more commercially viable.","India's edible vegetable oil imports in May rose 3% from April to 1.053 million tonnes, with palm oil continuing to cede its import share to rivals sunflower and soybean oil.

56,"US OUTLOOK AND MODEL DISCUSSION 6- TO 10-DAY PERIOD:

There is a ridge in Hudson Bay with another in Texas with troughs across the Southeast and West. Later this week, the southern ridge will shift to the Rockies and the Canadian ridge moves east, allowing a channel through the Corn Belt for systems to travel. The trough in the West will do so this weekend while another does so later next week. Each may get caught up in the Eastern U.S. for a time. The western ridge may extend up through western Canada next week.

The U.S. and European models continue to have issues with inconsistency with details, but still show the same setup. I will use a blend but favor the European.

For the outlook period, temperatures will be variable for most of the country with systems moving through, though consistently hotter around Texas. A system will be moving through the Corn Belt over the weekend into early next week.

Widespread showers should develop across the Corn Belt with this system, though to what degree is still unknown. Another system should move through later next week with widespread showers across portions of the Corn Belt as well.

NORTHERN PLAINS (LIVESTOCK/WHEAT/CORN/SOYBEANS): A system went through with only isolated showers over the holiday weekend, and missed some of the driest areas in the eastern Dakotas. A slow-moving front took its place however, and should provide some strings of showers throughout the week until a system goes through on Friday and Saturday that is forecast to bring more widespread showers and thunderstorms. Ahead of this front, temperatures are hot with many areas eclipsing 90 degrees F. If showers disappoint, crop conditions will continue to decline and drought will expand. Temperatures should be more variable after the system moves through this weekend.

CENTRAL/SOUTHERN PLAINS (WHEAT/LIVESTOCK/CORN/SOYBEANS): Areas of showers and thunderstorms have moved through over the last several days, especially in a band between Colorado and Oklahoma, where heavier rain and severe weather have caused some flooding and damage. Heat has built in over Texas and has expanded north, a consistent feature until a system moves through this weekend.

Temperatures will be more variable after its passage, but Texas will still remain hot. More rounds of showers and thunderstorms are forecast until that system moves through, and may even continue next week as well, most likely farther north. Conditions for developing corn and soybeans is dependent on rainfall frequency. Those areas with consistent rainfall are more able to withstand the heat stress.

MIDWEST (WINTER WHEAT/CORN/SOYBEANS): A system clipped western and southern areas of the region over the long holiday weekend. Some areas of good rain fell, but were not widespread. Some areas ended up dry and are seeing temperatures increase into the 90s this week. The system continues to spin over the Southeast and though uncertain, may spread some showers into eastern areas later this week. Following that, a system will move through with more widespread showers and thunderstorms this weekend into early next week, with potential for continued showers for a couple of days and another system late next week or weekend to do something similar. Areas missing out are seeing stress increase for both corn and soybeans, though not all areas are dealing with harsh conditions. The coming rainfall is forecast to only be a stop-gap in the poorer conditions, but the pattern does favor better chances for rain after this week.

DELTA (SOYBEANS/COTTON): Several disturbances brought heavy showers and severe weather through the region over the last week. Though damage has been reported, the increased soil moisture is turning around dryness concerns. Though less active for the next week, there will be some additional chances for showers and thunderstorms in the region.

CANADIAN PRAIRIES (SPRING WHEAT/CANOLA): Another system moved into the region over the weekend and brought heavy rain to parts of Alberta and Saskatchewan again. The system will be in place through Thursday, though showers will become more isolated each day this week. Soil moisture is still reported to be low across much of the region, leaving some areas in desperate need of rainfall.

Temperatures will be more pleasant as this system passes through, keeping stress down for those drier areas, however.","The DTN Ag Weather Brief offers a 6-to 10-day outlook for the upcoming week, with the outlook for most of the country showing variable temperatures, with a system moving through the Corn Belt, the Rockies, Canadian ridge, and troughs across the Southeast and West. The western ridge may extend up through western Canada next week, and temperatures should remain high with many areas eclipsing 90 degrees F. Temperatures should be more variable after the system moves through this weekend, with more rounds of showers and thunderstorms expected to bring more widespread showers and severe weather. Northern and southern areas of the region should remain dry and dry, but conditions for developing corn and soybeans are dependent on rainfall frequency. The coming rainfall is forecast to only be a stop-gap in the poorer conditions, but the pattern does favor better chances for rain after this week.",0
